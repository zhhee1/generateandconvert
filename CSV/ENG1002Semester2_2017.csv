Teaching and learning method
Teaching and Learning Method
In this unit, formal contact hours consist of lectures and practice classes. Learning in the unit is 
through a multiple methods consisting of:
●pre-lecture reading with online quiz assessment
●lecture and practical class participation
●completion of worksheet booklets
●completion of two major projects
●completing problem sheets throughout the semester
Practical class allocation
There are 3-hours of practice classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 1. Students 
must enrol in one practice class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular 
practice class will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit 
coordinator. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence 
is shown that timetabling means that is the only session possible.
Teaching Approach
In a typical week, students are expected to:
●Read selected unit materials and watch online videos . This prior to attending lecture classes
will be assessed in a weekly in Moodle.pre-lecture online quiz 
●Attend lectures that focus on the application of the weekly discipline specific topics and 
examples. Participation in lectures will be assessed via the use of audience response 
systems.
●Perform self-study to work their way through the problem sheets with included solutions.

6. Apply energy balance analysis to determine the enthalpy and temperature of a system for 
engineering systems with and without chemical reactions.
7. Determine the expansion of materials as the temperature of the material is increased.
8. Apply the concept of resistivity in calculating the resistance of an electrical component.
9. Identify how the band gap of a material influences its optical and electronic properties and 
explain how the chemistry of a semiconductor affects its electronic properties.
10. Function as part of a team and communicate effectively with team members.
11. Generate and present written reports in a professional engineering format from a 
template.

----------------Page (15) Break----------------

The CATME online peer assessment tool will be used to allow team members to anonymously rate 
the contributions made to each team project by both themselves and their team mates. Students 
will be required to complete a calibration process which demonstrates how the system should be 
used. At the conclusion of each major project they will then rate themselves and their team mates 
on the basis of five key criteria, and using a behaviourally anchored scale. The individual ratings 
you give each person are not viewable or shared with other team members, but will be reviewed 
by the teaching staff.
You will be asked to justify (via comments) why you rated particular people high or low.
Based on these ratings a Peer Assessment Factor will be calculated by the system for each team 
member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the written 
comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.1, but for the vast majority of 
student it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be returned confidentially to students via 
Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an  individual mark for each student's project 
work, based on their team’s mark for each of the major projects.
Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow them to see, for 
each of the five questions, an arrow indicating:
●how they scored themselves;
●the AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
●the AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members
CATME will also provide detailed research-based suggestions for improvement based on where 
your results fall relative to the rest of the team.

Assessment title: SPECIAL ASSESSMENT FOR REPEATING STUDENTS
 Mode of delivery:ON campus
Details of task: The continuous assessment grades obtained for the two major projects undertaken 
in ENG1002 and practice class work, totalling 45% of the continuous assessment mark, cannot be 
.  carried forward in subsequent enrolment and assessment
Students in the following categories will be required to repeat all project and practice class work:
●Students that received less than an average of 0.8 for their CATME peer assessment factors 
in their previous semester, indicating they did not contribute satisfactorily to the projects,
●Students that withdrew from the unit before its completion
Students that completed the unit previously with average CATME peer assessment factors greater 
than or equal to 0.8, and only failed the exam hurdle will be required to complete the following 
alternative assessment, in place of the projects and practice classes: 
●3 x 1.5 hour online Moodle quizzes, each worth 15% of their continuous assessment, spaced 
throughout the semester.
●Each quiz will be related to a single engineering discipline (Chemical, Materials, Electrical)
These students will not be allocated to teams and do not need to attend practice classes.
These students must also complete the following assessment tasks:

----------------Page (20) Break----------------
22
Practical class allocation
There are 3-hours of practice classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 1. Students 
must enrol in one practice class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular 
practice class will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit 
coordinator. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence 
is shown that timetabling means that is the only session possible.
Teaching Approach
In a typical week, students are expected to:
●Read selected unit materials and watch online videos . This prior to attending lecture classes
will be assessed in a weekly in Moodle.pre-lecture online quiz 
●Attend lectures that focus on the application of the weekly discipline specific topics and 
examples. Participation in lectures will be assessed via the use of audience response 
systems.
●Perform self-study to work their way through the problem sheets with included solutions.
●Complete worksheet booklets to be assessed in selected practice classes
●Participate in practical classes, which will include a mix of activities that
●teach teamwork, information literacy and writing skills
●apply discipline specific knowledge gained in lectures in hands-on experiments
●consolidate discipline specific knowledge in question and answer sessions with 
demonstrators on problem sheets
●Work in teams on completing the two major projects for the unit.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

used. At the conclusion of each major project they will then rate themselves and their team mates 
on the basis of five key criteria, and using a behaviourally anchored scale. The individual ratings 
you give each person are not viewable or shared with other team members, but will be reviewed 
by the teaching staff.
You will be asked to justify (via comments) why you rated particular people high or low.
Based on these ratings a Peer Assessment Factor will be calculated by the system for each team 
member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the written 
comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.1, but for the vast majority of 
student it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be returned confidentially to students via 
Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an  individual mark for each student's project 
work, based on their team’s mark for each of the major projects.
Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow them to see, for 
each of the five questions, an arrow indicating:
●how they scored themselves;
●the AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
●the AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members
CATME will also provide detailed research-based suggestions for improvement based on where 
your results fall relative to the rest of the team.
