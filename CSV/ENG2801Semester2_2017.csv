Teaching and learning method
This unit is designed for engineering students in Monash University Malaysia. This unit covers 3 
aspects of the 12 program outcomes required by the engineering accreditation under the Board of 
Engineers Malaysia. On the other hand, this unit also fulfils Ministry of Education (MoE) general 
studies requirements in the category of mastery of skill (U2) and broaden knowledge of Malaysia 
(U3).
This unit adopt problem based learning (PBL) approach. Integrated lecture sessions alternate 
between 10-15 minutes lecturer’s explanation and 10-15 minutes tutorial exercises. Tutorial 
questions will be given during class which are to be solved and submit on the spot. This is to 
enhance understanding of concepts right after it is taught. Pre-class preparation is not required, 
but paying attention during class is important. Self-study quizzes will be prepared in exam 
questions format and made available in Moodle to compliment the integrated lecture sessions.
Methodology learnt in the integrated lecture sessions will be used to design new product and 
industry solution in the project. Tutorial sessions start with a team development program that 
consist of team building activities and team development quizzes. The project team formed during 
the team development program will work on the project which includes peer assessment, group 
meeting and design documentation. Design and documentation work are to be completed during 
the tutorial session itself. This is to eliminate the difficulties to find a common group meeting time. 
Product design competition and exhibition will be organised to invite public opinion from the local 
community. The product designed by all groups in this unit is mandatory to join this competition 
and exhibition. This event allows students to observe how different group of people will have 
different opinion.
Learning outcomes
This unit aims to link leadership skills to product innovation and explore the product development 
and commercialisation process. At the end of this unit, students should be able to:
1. Discuss the leadership process in real life scenarios based on literature and Internet 
resources.
2. Explain ideas effectively, on paper and on digital platform, by working in a team that 
consist of members with different personality types.
3. Design an innovative product with commercialisation potentials in the context of the 
Malaysia community.
