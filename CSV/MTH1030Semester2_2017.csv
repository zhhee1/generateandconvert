Academic overview
Learning outcomes
On completion of this unit students will be able to:
1. Understand the basic concepts of linear algebra, recognise and manipulate elements of 
vector spaces;
2. Formulate and solve equations involving vectors and matrices, including for three-
dimensional geometry;
3. Identify and evaluate improper integrals;
4. Solve simple first and second order differential equations, and formulate them for 
applications to physical systems;
5. Compute Taylor series expansions, with remainder, for functions of one variable;
6. Apply Taylor series and l'Hopital's rule to compute limits;
7. Understand and compute the convergence properties of infinite series;
8. Provide written reports that contain complete mathematical arguments.
Teaching approach
In MTH1030 there will be 5 contact hours per week:
• Three one-hour lectures per week.
• One two-hour support class per week
Lectures
The material in lectures will be presented by hand – a live human will create real mathematics 
before your eyes.
The material presented in each lecture will be drawn from a set of lecture notes that will be 
available on the unit’s Moodle website.

----------------Page (3) Break----------------

Our lectures will be recorded (audio + (usually) both the projected screens) and the recordings will 
be available via a link on the unit's Moodle website. It sometimes happens that lectures do not end 
up being recorded because of technical issues.
Support classes (also sometimes referred to as tutorials or lab classes)
The required to be able to actually do mathematics is the focus of the 2-hour support methods 
class in MTH1030. Whereas the lectures cover motivations, theory, proofs, applications and some 
examples, the support classes will be on the functional side of mastering techniques and notations. 
They are typically brief high-powered bursts of information that students are then expected to be 
able to use to relate to different problems in their own study time. The problems sets for MTH1030 
(also available on the unit's Moodle website) will be the primary source material for these classes.
Communication of Mathematics 
In this unit we will also pay a great deal of attention to how well mathematics can be 
communicated. Becoming familiar with the logic, language, formalisms and notation of 
mathematics is a challenge and will require some effort. You will be provided with examples of 
good communication in the notes and during lectures/support classes to guide you in this 
endeavour. Of course if you already have good habits and organisation then all this is so much 
easier to master!
Attention to detail in what you are saying is essential as mathematics has a concise syntax that 
can have quite different meanings attached to marginally different propositions. You will have 
plentiful opportunities to improve your mathematics expression throughout the course.
Talking to the lecturers and other students should be something you practice regularly because 
often what you think you know on paper is actually quite different to that which you verbalise. Many 
times it won’t be until a person clearly articulates an idea that they truly understand it.
Be prepared to write or come up with solutions in small groups on the boards as this will also give 
confidence in skills and communication as the course progresses.
You can also find information on inclusive teaching practices for students with learning disabilities 
or mental health conditions at: www.monash.edu.au/lls/inclusivity/
 
Feedback to you
The feedback you will receive during your university studies is probably quite different from what 
you have been used to in school. The first big difference is the huge number of students 
undertaking each unit, which does not allow for the same one-on-one interaction as when you 
learn in small groups. Secondly, university students are adults and hence are expected to take 
responsibility for their own learning (spoon feeding is now in the past!)
However, you will still receive plenty of feedback on your progress, but you must look for it! In

However, you will still receive plenty of feedback on your progress, but you must look for it! In 
MTH1030, the following opportunities should help you get a sense of how you are doing:
Lectures and support classes
Lectures are not just a one-way street – you are actively encouraged to ask questions during  and 
after the lectures. If there is some point that you feel unsure about don’t be shy, ask the lecturer to 
clarify the point. The same is true for the support classes.
Assignments and test
Always look through the marked assignments, and read the comments given by your support-class 
leader either written on the assignment itself or in class to the whole group. Always ask if there is 
something that is not clear to you. 
 
Assessment summary

Lab classes
You should allocate yourself to a lab class through . In the first two weeks of classes, ALLOCATE+
all timetable issues need to be resolved by sending an email to . The allocate@sci.monash.edu.au
teaching staff cannot make changes to your allocation. After the second week, see the Reception 
Office of the School of Mathematical Sciences (4th floor, building 28) for any changes to the lab

Office of the School of Mathematical Sciences (4th floor, building 28) for any changes to the lab 
class allocation. It is your responsibility to be properly enrolled in the lab class you attend, as 
otherwise your semester marks may be displaced.
Assignments
Format
To get full marks your assignment
must be neatly presented, but does not necessarily have to be typed;
must not contain any mistakes (mathematical, logical, spelling, etc.);
must be self-contained, including the statement of a problems at the beginning, and answers 
to whatever questions were asked at the end;
 must be understandable without too much effort by other students taking this course;
 must contain a clear description of the mathematics that justifies everything you do in full 
.English sentences
A lot of this is about the way you present your work. Just to put a figure to it, you can lose up to 
30% of the total marks for poor presentation. In particular, if your handwriting is illegible, whatever 
you are writing about will not be counted. If you have problems in this respect you may want to 
consider typing everything up after all.
Assignment submission
You must submit your assignments to your support-class leader in hardcopy form by 5 pm on the 
day that an assignment is due. To submit an assignment, either hand it to your support-class 
leader during one of your lab classes or deposit it in his or her assignment box on the ground floor 
of the maths building (building 28). Note that you won’t be able to find your support-class leader’s 
assignment box unless you know their name (ask them or find out on ) Also, if you do ALLOCATE+!
not submit your assignment in the correct assignment box, your assignment will not be marked 
and you will receive 0 marks on your assignment!
The submission dates are clearly stated on each assignment and in this unit guide. All 
assignments will be available for download from the website three weeks prior to their due date.
It is strongly recommended that students make a copy of the final version of their assignments 
prior to its submission, for example with their phone or using a scanner.
Students who have attempted this unit previously must complete all assessment tasks again. No 
marks can be carried across from a previous enrolment in the unit.
Extensions, late submission and penalties
MTH1030 Techniques for modelling - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (6) Break----------------
8
The penalty for assignments submitted late is 10 marks per day late or part thereof. Weekends 
and holidays attract the same penalty as weekdays. No assignment can be accepted for 
assessment more than eight days after the due date except in exceptional circumstances and in 
consultation with the unit coordinator. Late assignments can be e-mailed to the unit coordinator.
If you have any valid reason why you are unable to submit your assignment by the due date you 
must contact your unit coordinator before the due date. In all other cases late penalties will apply 
(see below).
The process for submitting special consideration applications for missing due dates is outlined 
below.
Support-class leaders are not authorised to approve extensions to deadlines.
Please make sure to submit your own work. It is okay, and we even encourage you to discuss a 
problem with other students who are taking the course to try to understand how to attack it (and to 
avoid going completely off the mark). However, in the end you have to do your own calculations 
and you have to write up your own report in your own words.
Monash University is very picky about this last point and, to make sure that you understand how 
serious this is, requires that you attach a completed assignment cover sheet to the front of your 
assignment. Make sure that you understand what you are signing there. You can download a copy 
of the coversheet from the unit’s website.
Returning marked assignments
Whenever possible marked assignments will be returned to you within two weeks after they were 
due. Your marks will also be posted in the Grade Book on Moodle at around the same time and 
you should check these have been recorded correctly. If any of them have been entered 
incorrectly you must query them with your support-class leader in a timely manner. (If work is 
consistently being handed back late to you, or your marks are not posted on Moodle within a week 
of receiving your marked work, please advise the unit coordinator.) If you are unable to collect your 
work at the usual class, please ask your support-class leader at the next class. Any uncollected 
work after the end of semester can be retrieved from the unit coordinator up until the end of the 
examination period.
If you believe that an error has been made in the marking of any assessment, for example missed 
working or a mistake in the addition of marks, you should discuss that with your support-class 
leader initially. If you are not satisfied with their response you should contact the unit coordinator.
Resubmission of assignments
You will normally not be allowed to re-submit your work for assessment except in exceptional 
circumstances and only with written consent of the unit coordinator.

Examination(s)
Final Exam (60% of final mark)
The final exam will run for three hours. A mock exam with solutions will be made available on the 
unit web site towards the end of the semester.
No calculators, textbooks or notes of any kind will be allowed in the test or in the exam. You will be 
provided with a formula sheet as part of the test and the exam and a copy of this formula sheet will 
be also be available on the unit web site from around the middle of the semester.
The final exam is a hurdle for this unit. To pass this unit a you must achieve at least 50% overall 
and at least 40% for the end-of-semester exam.
Midsemester test (8.75% of final mark)
There will be a test towards the middle of the semester that will be held during one of your lab 
classes. It will give you a taste for what to expect in the final exam.

must be neatly presented, but does not necessarily have to be typed;
must not contain any mistakes (mathematical, logical, spelling, etc.);
must be self-contained, including the statement of a problems at the beginning, and answers 
to whatever questions were asked at the end;
must be understandable without too much effort by other students taking this unit;
must contain a clear description of the mathematics that justifies everything you do in full 
.English sentences
A lot of this is about the way you present your work. Just to put a figure to it, you can lose up to 
30% of the total marks for poor presentation. In particular, if your handwriting is illegible, whatever 
you are writing about will not be counted. If you have problems in this respect you may want to 
consider typing everything up after all.
Assignment submission

----------------Page (8) Break----------------

You must submit your assignments to your support-class leader in hardcopy form by 5 pm on the 
day that an assignment is due. To submit an assignment, either hand it to your support-class 
leader during one of your support classes or deposit it in his or her assignment box on the ground 
floor of the maths building (9 Rainforest walk/building 28). Note that you won’t be able to find your 
support-class leader’s assignment box unless you know their name (ask them or find out on 
) Also, if you do not submit your assignment in the correct assignment box, your ALLOCATE+!
assignment will not be marked and you will receive 0 marks on your assignment!
The submission dates are clearly stated on each assignment and in this unit guide. All 
assignments will be available for download from the website three weeks prior to their due date.
It is strongly recommended that students make a copy of the final version of their assignments 
prior to its submission, for example with their phone or using a scanner.
Students who have attempted this unit previously must complete all assessment tasks again. No 
marks can be carried across from a previous enrolment in the unit.
Extensions, late submission and penalties
The penalty for assignments submitted late is 10 marks per day late or part thereof. Weekends 
and holidays attract the same penalty as weekdays. No assignment can be accepted for 
assessment more than eight days after the due date except in exceptional circumstances and in 
consultation with the unit coordinator. Late assignments can be e-mailed to the unit coordinator.
If you have any valid reason why you are unable to submit your assignment by the due date you 
must contact your unit coordinator before the due date. In all other cases late penalties will apply 
(see below).
The process for submitting special consideration applications for missing due dates is outlined 
below.
Support-class leaders are not authorised to approve extensions to deadlines.
Please make sure to submit your own work. It is okay, and we even encourage you to discuss a 
problem with other students who are taking the unit to try to understand how to attack it (and to 
avoid going completely off the mark). However, in the end you have to do your own calculations 
and you have to write up your own report in your own words.
Monash University is very picky about this last point and, to make sure that you understand how 
serious this is we require that you attach a completed assignment cover sheet to the front of your 
assignment. Make sure that you understand what you are signing there. You can download a copy 
of the coversheet from the unit’s website.

Returning marked assignments
Whenever possible marked assignments will be returned to you within two weeks after they were 
due. Your marks will also be posted in the  on  at around the same time and Grade BookMoodle
you should check these have been recorded correctly. If any of them have been entered 
incorrectly you must query them with your support-class leader in a timely manner. (If work is 
consistently being handed back late to you, or your marks are not posted on Moodle within a week 
of receiving your marked work, please advise the unit coordinator.) If you are unable to collect your 
work at the usual class, please ask your support-class leader at the next class. Any uncollected 
work after the end of semester can be retrieved from the unit coordinator up until the end of the 
examination period.
If you believe that an error has been made in the marking of any assessment, for example missed 
working or a mistake in the addition of marks, you should discuss that with your support-class 
leader initially. If you are not satisfied with their response you should contact the unit coordinator.
Resubmission of assignments
You will normally not be allowed to re-submit your work for assessment except in exceptional 
circumstances and only with written consent of the unit coordinator.
Support classes (participation in these is worth 5% of final mark)
You should allocate yourself to a support class through . In the first two weeks of ALLOCATE+
classes, all timetable issues need to be resolved by sending an email to allocate@sci.monash.edu.
. The teaching staff cannot make changes to your allocation. After the second week, see the au
Reception Office of the School of Mathematical Sciences (4th floor, 9 Rainforest walk/building 28) 
for any changes to the support class allocation. It is your responsibility to be properly enrolled in 
the support class you attend, as otherwise your semester marks may be displaced.
You can get a total of 100 marks for participation in support classes. 70 out of those 100 marks 
you get for being present for the full duration of at least 8 of the 12 support classes. You will get 
none of these 70 marks if you attend less support classes without a valid (in the usual sense) 
reason. If you miss one of your support classes the only way you can make up for it is by attending 
another support class during the same week, just let the support class leader in charge know.
You will get up to 30 marks at the discretion of your support class leader for participating in 
disscussions, answering questions, etc. during support classes.
 
Applications for special consideration
Students with a valid reason for late submission of an assignment, or for missing a quiz or mid-
semester test, must provide the unit coordinator with originals of appropriate documentation within 
two working days of the normal deadline for that piece of work. This application must be submitted 
directly to the unit coordinator in bldg. 28, room 411 (or slip them under the door if there is nobody

directly to the unit coordinator in bldg. 28, room 411 (or slip them under the door if there is nobody 
in the office at that time). The unit coordinator will advise you of the outcome of the application by 
email.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

Unit resources
Learning resources
Lecture notes/books
A complete set of lecture notes, written specifically for this unit will be available from the unit web 
site. The lecture notes we provide are very comprehensive. This means that you do not need to 
buy a textbook. 
You should be fine just reading the lecture notes. However, if you find some parts of the lecture 
notes hard to understand you may also want to consult some websites and books dealing with 
material similar to that covered in our course. In general, the Wikipedia pages dealing with 
mathematical topics are excellent and so are the  pages hosted by Wolfram Research. Mathworld
There are also lots of good books on linear algebra and calculus in the library. Two books we 
particularly recommend and which are used in more advanced units here at Monash are the 
following:
Anton & Rorres,  Elementary Linear Algebra, 11th Edition, Wiley (2014).
and
Stewart, Calculus, Early Transcendentals Version 6 or 7 (2008, 2012)
You can purchase these books from the Monash bookstore and there are a limited number of 
copies in the library.
Unit website
Unit information, lecture notes, assignments, exercises, all handouts and notices will be available 
on the web through Moodle (click ).here
Mathematics Learning Centre
