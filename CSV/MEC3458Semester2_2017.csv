Teaching and learning method
Teaching and Learning Method
The unit takes a blended learning approach, using online lectures and activities which are explored 
in-depth during class time. Learning in the unit is mainly through the initial labs and group project 
which extends for the second half of semester and has a number of  components which build to 
form the final project. The main learning approach is “Problem- based learning” which requires 
students to be involved with the project and proactive learners. There are no right or wrong 
MEC3458 Experimental project - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
12
students to be involved with the project and proactive learners. There are no right or wrong 
answers to many of the project questions. This does not imply  that any answer is adequate. Some 
answers will be better than others as they achieve the criteria in a better way.
Lab class allocation
There are 2-hours of laboratory classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 2. Students 
must enrol in one lab class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular lab class 
will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit coordinator. Once a 
particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence is shown that 
timetabling means that is the only session possible. In this case, a swap will be arranged.
Equipment availability means that the number of students in each session must be limited. 
Communication, participation and feedback
We aim to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing feedback 
throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice classes, 
individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, discussions in 
class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment marks and grades. You are 
encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their/your
Learning.
There is a significant amount of group work involved in this unit. Students will be
assigned to groups using the CATME online tool.
*CATME Online Peer Assessment:
Group projects will use the CATME online peer assessment tool. This tool will be used to
allow team members to anonymously rate the contributions made to each team project by
both themselves and their team mates. Students will be required to complete a calibration
process which demonstrates how the system should be used. At the conclusion of each major
project they will then rate themselves and their teammates on the basis of five key criteria,
and using a behaviourally anchored scale. The individual ratings you give each person are not
viewable or shared with other team members, but will be reviewed by the teaching staff.

3.  
viewable or shared with other team members, but will be reviewed by the teaching staff.
You will be asked to justify (via comments) why you rated particular people high or low. You
are NOT allowed to simply rate everyone the same, or have your team all give each member the 
same ratings. This will incur an automatic -10% penalty if you do so.
Based on these ratings a will be calculated by the system for each Peer Assessment Factor (PAF) 
team member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the 
written comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.1, but for the vast majority 
of students in well-functioning teams, it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be 
returned confidentially to students via Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an 
individual mark for each student’s project work, based on their team’s mark for each of the major 
team projects.
Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow them to see, for 
each of the five questions an arrow indicating:
How they scored themselves;
The AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
The AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members.
CATME will also provide detailed suggestions for improvement based on where your results fall 
relative to the rest of the team.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
MEC3458 Experimental project - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (28) Break----------------
30
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Section C: All students 
Extensions and penalties
University and faculty policy on assessment
Due date and extensions
The due dates for the submission of assignments are given in the previous section. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
 the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificate.before
The form should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, sent to the unit or campus 
coordinator. The email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in 
lieu of signature.
Note that other lecturers cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in-charge (unit coordinator) will indicate 
at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the submitted work.
If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assignment.
Late assignment
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
the work, but 10% of the total marks available for that assessment component will usually be 
deducted for each day late.
No assignment will be accepted once an assignment has been returned to the class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assignments to safeguard 
against the loss of work through accident or error.
Return dates
Students can expect assignments to be returned within two weeks of the submission date or after 
receipt, whichever is later.
Assessment for the unit as a whole is in accordance with the provisions of the Monash University 
Education Policy at:
http://www.policy.monash.edu/policybank/academic/education/assessment/index.html 
MEC3458 Experimental project - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017

Resubmission of assignments
Returning assignments
Any hardcopy assignments are to be returned lecture or practice classes
Resubmission of assignments
Assignments can only be resubmitted with the approval of the lecturer.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
