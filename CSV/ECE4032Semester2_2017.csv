Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit aims to firstly develop an understanding of key features of methods for mathematically 
modelling various categories of dynamical systems in terms of sets of dynamic and algebraic 
equations, ranging from engineering to biomedical systems. Secondly, students are shown how to 
write algorithms for efficient numerical solution of these equations. Computer-aided control 
systems design using optimal and robust control methods is then covered. Thirdly, students are 
introduced to Lyapunov and function analytic techniques for nonlinear systems stability analysis, 
and to nonlinear control design methods including feedback linearisation, sliding mode and 
passivity-based control techniques.

Teaching and learning method
The unit consists of lectures which cover both theory and problem solving. Problem solving is 
further reinforced through a series of 12 tutorial classes,using assigned problems that will be 
selected from the prescribed text and advised in advance of each session. Topic tests and informal 
discussion provide feedback on students’ performance. In order to illustrate the practical 
applications of the subject matter, and provide feedback on students’ analysis and written 
communication skills, 4 laboratory/computational experiments are included with clear reporting and 
marking expectations. 
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:
1. Generate dynamic models using various system identification techniques/tools such as 
(but not limited to) step response identification, least squares and the System Identification 
Toolbox.
2. Design optimal controllers and observers for both continuous-time and discrete-time 
dynamic systems.
3. Analyse robustness of uncertain systems and to suggest suitable controller structures.
4. Use various methods to design controllers and observers for nonlinear systems, such as 
(but not limited to) feedback linearisation, diffeomorphism, and Linear Matrix Inequalities.
5. Discern the need for life-long learning about advanced control technique.
6. Design and simulate controllers and observers using computer-aided tools.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
Some changes are made (e.g. more material such as Model Predictive Control and Kalman Filters) 
but they are not due to SETU results.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
●Explanations very clear.
●Organized structure.
●Extraordinary lecturer.

Assessment summary
Continuous assessment: 40%
Examination (2 hours): 60%
Students are required to achieve at least 45% in the total continuous assessment component 
(assignments, tests, mid-semester exams, laboratory reports) and at least 45% in the final 
examination component and an overall mark of 50% to achieve a pass grade in the unit. Students 
failing to achieve this requirement will be given a maximum of 45% in the unit.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
Key for the LO-assessment relationship table above:
Cognitive

Knowledge:
Remembers

learned 
material
Comprehension:
Grasps the 
meaning of 
material (lowest 
level of

Application:
Uses learning 
in new and 
concrete 
situations 
(higher level

Analysis:
Understands 
both the 
content and 
structure of 
material
Synthesis:

from 
existing 
knowledge 
and skills
Evaluation:

Assessment tasks
Assessment title: Lab/Assignments 1-4
 Practical lab experiment or simulation assignmentMode of delivery:
Details of task: You will be given 4 lab experiments or simulation assignments to conduct, and will 
have to write a report based on your findings and relate them to the theory that you have learnt.
 You will be assessed on your ability to run the experiment, and also based on the report that you 
submit.
