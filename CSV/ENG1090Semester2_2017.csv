Teaching approach
ENG1090 is taught using a combination of lectures and support classes (tutorials).
There will be thirty three one-hour lectures with normally three one-hour lectures per week. The 
ENG1090 lectures at the Malaysia campus are presented in lecture theatre 6006 on Mondays at 4-
6pm and in lecture theatre 6005 on Tuesdays at 11am-noon. Students are advised to attend every 
lecture in order to gain full advantage of the teaching and only use the printed materials on Moodle 
as a fallback to check back on any points that they missed.
Students are also expected to attend one two-hour support class (tutorial) per week from the 
second week of semester (commencing Thursday 3 August). These support classes are intended 
to help students gain assistance with the theory described in lectures and the practice exercises 
provided on the ‘problem sets’ – see under 'Learning resources' below for additional details. Most

provided on the ‘problem sets’ – see under 'Learning resources' below for additional details. Most 
students will have eleven support classes for ENG1090 over weeks 2-12.
 
Feedback to you
Feedback is provided to ENG1090 students during the semester, to assist their learning and help 
them identify the issues for which they may need to seek further assistance. This includes through:
●individual and group consultations with staff during the weekly two-hour support classes;
●written feedback on five short hand-written assignments submitted at some support classes, 
usually marked and returned at the next class with sample solutions on Moodle;
●six short quizzes in some support classes with the marked quiz returned at the next class;
●encouraging students to ask questions during or after lectures;
●individual or group consultations at the Lecturer’s office during their weekly consultation 
hours, at other times by appointment via email;
●prompt responses to administrative and curriculum queries via the ENG1090 discussion 
groups on Moodle;
●timely responses by the Lecturer to emails on individual/private matters (only).
In particular, it is also strongly recommended that all ENG1090 students take full advantage of the 
individual assistance and feedback provided in the support classes. The style of teaching and 
learning at university is different from that at school, and students are expected to take 
responsibility for their own learning – in most cases, . no one will be keeping a close eye on you
This is not just true in this unit, but also most other units offered at any university! Assistance is 
available, but you need to seek it out.

* The first assessment for ENG1090 is a quiz held in the first support class in week 2, covering 
prerequisite mathematics knowledge (as listed on the 'Background material' sheet on Moodle).
** As the normal support classes in week 6 fall on university holidays, Quiz 3 will be held at 5.30
pm in the Monday lecture on that week.
***  Students whose normal support class falls on a university holiday (such on Friday 22 
September) must hand in their assignment to the Lecturer by 2.45pm on the previous working day.
Non-submission of assessed work
If you are unable to complete any assessed tasks for this unit, for reasons outside of your control, 
please read carefully the section below on 'Applications for special consideration'. In accordance 
with University policy, these must be submitted in a timely manner. See also the section 
'Extensions and penalties' towards the end of this Unit Guide. 
Use of calculators in ENG1090
One of the objectives of ENG1090, and indeed university-level studies in general, is to help 
students improve their knowledge and develop a sound understanding of the material in the 
syllabus. Final answers for some of the problems covered in ENG1090 can often be obtained 
using calculators (and/or software such as Mathematica or online resources such as ‘Wolfram 
Alpha’), but unfortunately that can encourage a misleading and superficial ‘understanding’ of the 
basis or meaning of that answer. For this reason and others, the use of calculators (and extensive 
formula sheets) is not encouraged or expected in university-level mathematics units, and they are 
not permitted in quizzes or the final examination in ENG1090. If you already have a suitable 
calculator and know how to operate it, you may wish to make use of it (or other software) to double-
check your answers to questions on the problem sets, but in our experience your effort will be 
better spent in developing a sound knowledge and understanding by doing calculations by hand 
initially, and accompanying that with a clear explanation (preferably in English sentences) of how 
you obtained that answer. Those skills will take you much further.

Assessment requirements
Assessment tasks
Quizzes and assignments during semester determine 40% of the final unit mark for ENG1090, with 
 the remaining 60% based on results from the three-hour final examination.
Students who have attempted this unit previously must complete all assessment tasks again. No 
marks can be carried across from a previous enrolment in the unit.
Quizzes
These are held in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 (although in at the start of your normal support class 
week 6 it will be held earlier, at 5.30pm on the Monday). If you arrive once the quiz has already 
started then you will have less time to complete it, as to minimise disruption to the class all 
students must finish the quiz at the same time. Quizzes are 20 minutes in duration, with 5 minutes 
reading time, and have a short-answer format, sometimes with a few multiple-choice questions. 
The coverage of each quiz is listed in the 'Assessment summary table' above. The intention of the 
quizzes is to assist students to keep up with and understand the lecture material, and to provide 
feedback on their performance. Calculators (or electronic devices of any type) are not permitted at 
quizzes and no formula sheet is included. Sample solutions are not provided – if you are unsure 
about the correct answer once your marked quiz is returned, please ask your support-class leader 
individually to explain how the question should be answered during the support class at which your 
work is handed back to you.
Absence from a quiz
Absence from or arriving too late for any quiz will normally lead to a zero mark recorded for that 
quiz, unless a Special Consideration application (see below) has been approved by the Lecturer. 
With sufficient notice, it be possible to arrange that you sit a quiz at a different support class in may 
the same week, but only when written permission has been granted  by the Lecturer (in in advance
person or by email). Support-class leaders (tutors) are not authorised to approve exemptions from 
quizzes.
Assignments
These are normally due in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 at the start of your normal support class 
(although Assignment 4 for the Friday support class is due on the Thursday at 2.45pm). The 
requirements for each assignment will be made available on Moodle at the end of the last week of 
material that they cover (at 3pm on Friday). The method of submission of assignments is 
described in detail below under 'Assignment submission' so please read that carefully.
Marking criteria for assignments
Assignments for ENG1090 are marked on a range of criteria, including stating relevant reasons 
behind the process or results used, writing out appropriate and clear steps in the working, doing 
the working accurately, and then obtaining the correct final answer. All of these aspects are 
marked individually, and it is not just the final answer that is important. Indeed, it is possible to not 
pass an assignment by providing a correct answer with little (or an unclear) explanation. 
ENG1090 Foundation mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (7) Break----------------
9
marked individually, and it is not just the final answer that is important. Indeed, it is possible to not 
pass an assignment by providing a correct answer with little (or an unclear) explanation. 
Conversely, quite a few (but not all) marks can be obtained when the stated answer is incorrect but 
where a very clear and correct method was used, with all reasons provided and all appropriate 
working shown. But if the final answer is incorrect, for whatever reason, the question will not 
usually be awarded full marks - so check all working carefully, even for previous parts.
In ENG1090 it is also expected that you will be able to communicate both by using mathematics 
and by explaining that in written English. Some marks are awarded for each assignment on 
. An outline of the expectations on this communication skills in explaining the mathematical content
is provided in the ‘Guidelines for writing mathematics in ENG1090’ (which is available on Moodle). 
The key point is that it is not only the answer that is important, but also explaining (in sentences) 
clearly and logically how it was obtained.
Examination(s)
The final examination for ENG1090 will be held during the official university examination period at 
the end of semester. Students must achieve at least 45% in both the total in-semester assessment 
and the examination components, with an overall mark of at least 50%, to achieve a pass in 
 The date, time and location of the ENG1090 final examination will be published later in ENG1090.
the semester. In the meantime you must ensure that you are available for the entire three-week 
examination period.
The examination is closed-book, and calculators (of any kind) and summary sheets are NOT 
. A very short list of useful (unusual) formulae will be provided at the end of the permitted
examination paper, a copy of which will be provided on Moodle towards the end of semester. 
However, note that this list will NOT include material that is expected to be well known and 
understood for this and future units. Further information on the format of the final examination 
paper for ENG1090 will be made available on Moodle towards the end of semester. In accordance 
with policy for the engineering mathematics units, two sample examination papers (only) will be 
provided at that time, one with written solutions. These sample papers will be made available not 
earlier in the semester.
 
Applications for special consideration
If you are unable to complete an assignment, quiz or the final examination due to  exceptional
circumstances, for reasons out of your control, then you may be eligible for Special Consideration. 
The University has detailed procedures to be followed, see http://www.monash.edu.au/exams
./special-consideration.html
For issues related to quizzes and assignments in ENG1090 is important that you contact the 
 of this unit as soon as practicable, by email or in person. Students with a valid reason for Lecturer
late submission of an assignment, or for missing a quiz, must provide originals (and a copy) of 
suitable supporting documentation  of the normal deadline for that work.within two working days
Applications must be submitted directly to the  but can be sent by email initially and Lecturer
followed-up by a meeting shortly afterwards. The Lecturer will advise you of the outcome of the 
Special Consideration application by email, and if applicable will advise how to submit approved 
late assignments.
ENG1090 Foundation mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (8) Break----------------
10
These procedures are applied strictly for ENG1090 and late applications for Special Consideration 
are only accepted in exceptional circumstances (such as total incapacity). See also ‘Extensions 
and penalties’ towards the end of this Unit Guide.
Special Consideration applications for final end-of-semester examinations are submitted in a 
different manner, see .http://www.monash.edu.au/exams/special-consideration.html
Returning assignments
Return of marked work
Marked quizzes and assignments are normally returned at your support class following the one at 
which they were completed or submitted. Your marks will be posted on ‘Grades’ on Moodle at 
around the same time and you should check regularly that they are entered accurately – and if any 
have been entered incorrectly you must query them with your tutor . (If marked in a timely manner
work is consistently being handed back late, or your marks are not posted within a week of 
receiving your marked work, please advise the Lecturer.)
If you are unable to collect your work at the usual support class, please ask your tutor at the next 
class. Any uncollected work can be retrieved from the Lecturer up until after the end of semester 
the end of the examination period.
Errors in marking
Efforts are made to ensure that marks for assignments, quizzes and tests are awarded as 
consistently as possible across the various support classes (and markers if applicable). If you feel 
that an error may have been made in the marking of any assessment, for example missed working 
or incorrect addition of marks, you should discuss that with your support-class leader (tutor) 
initially. If you are not satisfied with the response by your tutor you may contact either the Campus 
Coordinator or Chief Examiner of ENG1090 to discuss your concerns.
Errors in recording grades
It is also your responsibility to check in a timely manner that the correct mark for the work has 
been recorded on Moodle, and to query that with your support-class leader initially. In accordance 
with the relevant Faculty policy, this should be done after the support no later than two weeks 
class at which that piece of work is normally returned.  
Assignment submission
Completed hand-written assignments must normally be handed in to the tutor at the 
. Separate sheets should be stapled, and each commencement of your assigned support class
sheet must show your name and student ID. Write and set out your submission neatly.
While care is taken, always make a copy of your final version prior to submission, for example with 
a phone camera or a scanner.
How and where to submit assignments
ENG1090 Foundation mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
11
Only hard-copy submissions are accepted, normally in person at your support class. Please DO 
NOT ever email copies to the tutor or Lecturer, DO NOT give them to others to submit on your 
behalf and DO NOT submit them via the School Office. See below about submitting assignments 
late, and the penalties that may be applied in that situation.
Cover sheet
All assignments must include a completed  official cover sheet showing the and signedday and time
of your normal support class and the of the class leader. The proforma for this sheet can be name 
downloaded from the ENG1090 Moodle site. Read the 'Student statement' fully before signing it.
Academic integrity
It is expected that all students will complete all assessed work for ENG1090 individually, and in 
their own words. Among other things, markers will be looking specifically for instances where the 
wording of submitted work is very similar, including identical errors in algebraic working or logic. 
Markers may also assess work across multiple support classes. Instances of suspected cheating 
This may include will be dealt with seriously, in accordance with Faculty and University policies. 
penalties when other students copy your work, so keep your completed assignment private.
Submitting early or late assignments
If you are unable to attend your normal support class for any good reason then your assignment 
should be submitted in person, and write the date and time of submission on the to the Lecturer 
cover sheet. See ‘Extensions and penalties’ later in this Unit Guide and, if appropriate, under 
'Applications for special consideration' above. No responsibility is taken for any assignments that 
are submitted in any manner other than those specified in this Unit Guide, including by email or 
being handed to other members of staff.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
The Moodle page for ENG1090 was completed restructured in 2017 in response to student 
feedback. The teaching methods of solving problems live in the lecture (by hand), in combination 
with detailed prepared slides shown on the screen, was originally developed for ENG1090 based 
on student feedback, as was the recording of lectures (at Clayton). The regular pattern of 
interspersed quizzes and assignments, and the marking of those within a week, apparently 
continue to be favoured by many students. At Clayton, the printing all of the ENG1090 teaching 
materials on Moodle as a spiral-bound book (and selling that to students via the Bookshop) was 
originally introduced in response to student comments.
The Unit Coordinator at Clayton examines all of the student SETU comments carefully each year 
and adjustments to the teaching are often made where the comments and suggestions are 
educationally sound. Identification of specific issues are particularly appreciated. (That said, it may 
be better to make comments or raise issues to the end of semester so you may also benefit.)prior

Students must check  for ENG1090 regularly for any announcements and act upon Moodle website
that information in a timely manner. The online teaching materials and resources for this unit are 
updated frequently throughout semester.
Students without their own computer or device, can access these materials via the Monash 
Library, or at an open-access computer laboratory.
Prescribed text
The prescribed textbook for ENG1090 (and the subsequent unit ENG1005) is James, Glyn: 
,  edition 2015, Pearson/Prentice Hall. Some of the problems Modern Engineering Mathematicsfifth
on the problem sets (see below) refer to this textbook so it is important to have access to it. Copies 
are available in the library but with large numbers of students enrolled in ENG1090 and ENG1005 
this semester it may be more convenient to have your own copy (and then perhaps sell it later).
Lecture notes
Copies of the lecture slides for ENG1090 are made available on Moodle. Note that the slides do 
not provide a complete record of the lecture as they do not include the additional worked examples 
that will be completed by the lecturer (live and by hand) on the screen during the lecture. Rather, 
the intention of providing the slides in advance is to enable students to annotate their copy during 
the lecture and to write in the worked examples for themselves. The material covered is quite 
sequential and it is likely that students will fall behind quickly if they miss more than a lecture or 
two in a row. You are therefore actively encouraged to keep up with the lectures and assessments.
Problem sets
A total of six ‘problem sets’, with practice exercises for the material covered in lectures, are 
provided during the semester – one for each of the six major topic areas. These are included in the 
book of lectures slides or can be downloaded from Moodle. Some questions from the textbook are 
included on these problem sets, especially on applications in engineering contexts, so students will 
need to have access to that book. Additional exercises can be found in the relevant sections of the 
textbook, or in similar books in the library (eg on the same shelf).
Weekly support classes
Two-hour weekly support classes (or 'tutorials') for ENG1090 commence from the second week of 
semester. If you have any difficulties with any material covered in lectures, or questions on the 
problem sets, you should actively seek assistance in your support class or approach the lecturer. 
Try all of the questions for yourself first but ask for help if you are having trouble getting started. 
Short final answers for most of the exercises are provided but the intention is that further individual 
assistance on to undertake and complete a problem is made available during each support how 
class. Take advantage of that assistance in a timely manner. Note that if you leave all of your 
queries to late in semester there may be insufficient time or support available to have them all 
answered before the final examination. Therefore, it is advised that you address any strongly 
difficulties .as soon as they become apparent
Support class sheets
‘Support class sheets’ will be provided on Moodle weekly, as a guide to the planned activities for 
each support class. These identify a small number of problems that are recommended (and 
expected) that all students will complete during that class and over the subsequent week. All of the

Bloom’s Taxonomy
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves  and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitiveknowledge
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the  with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective attitudes
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
Key for the table above:
Cognitive
LevelCategory
C1Knowledge: Remembers previously learned material
