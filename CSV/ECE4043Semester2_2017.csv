Synopsis
Students will study the characteristics of key components that make up optical communications 
systems including: lasers and advanced lightwave sources and direct modulation, optical 
modulators, optical fibres, optical amplifiers, filters and multiplexers, optical receivers and 
associated electronics. Secondly, students will use this knowledge to analyse and design optical

Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.

interactions between engineering 
systems and people in the social, 
cultural, environmental, commercial,

Teaching and learning method
The unit consists of lecture and practice/tutorial classes with a mix of computer based and 
practical laboratory exercises and a design project.
Lecture and tutorials or problem classes seminars:
The lectures provide an environment for learning about the fundamental concepts of optical 
communications, as well as an opportunity for feedback on student understanding through informal 
quizzes. The tutorials are an opportunity for problem-based leaning, taking the concepts from the 
lectures and providing concrete examples of their application.
Laboratory-based classes:
The laboratory session allow for problem-based learning with an element of enquiry-based 
approaches. They allow students to work on their skills in analysis. Model systems will help 
students identify key problem-solving approaches to the design and implementation of optical 
communication systems.
Simulation or virtual practice:
The design task in the latter weeks of the course provides a more open, enquiry-based learning 
approach, focused on a real-world problem of designing a long-haul optical fibre link in and 
Australian context. This task approximates the kind of project one might encounter working in 
optical communications.
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:

1. Describe the underlying physical principles of optical subsystems, and apply this 
understanding to predict and quantify the effect on optical fibre communication system 
performance.
2. Generate and analyse methods for increasing the data bandwidth of optical systems.
3. Quantify the performance of optical components within optical systems, and design 
systems to mitigate the effects of the performance constraints from components.
4. Simulate and predict the interactions of components, and both quantify and reflect upon 
their impact on performance metrics.
5. Research and appraise state-of-the-art optical technologies, and justify their incorporation 
into optical communications links for short-, medium- and long-haul applications.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●Feedback was good, no specific recommendation was made. Laboratory exercises have

Extensions and penalties
Due dates and extensions
The due dates for the submission of assignment and lab reports are given in the previous sections. 
Please make every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume 
that granting of an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificate. before The 
sent to the unit coordinator. The form should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, 
email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in lieu of signature. 
Note that other lecturers cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in- charge (unit coordinator) will 
indicate at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the 
submitted work. If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assignment.
Late submission
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
ECE4043 Optical communications - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (14) Break----------------
16
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
the work, but 10% of the total marks available for that assessment component will usually be 
deducted for each day late. No assignment/report will be accepted once an assignment/report has 
been returned to the class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assignments to safeguard 
against the loss of work through accident or error.
Returning assignments
Students can expect assignments to be returned within two weeks of the submission date or after 
receipt, whichever is later.
Resubmission of assignments
Resubmission is not allowed, but late submission is allowed under extreme health or similar 
extreme situations on which student did not have any control.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,

Feedback to you 
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of feedback 
throughout their studies. In this unit the student will receive feedback on conceptual understanding 
through exercises in lectures, problem solving during the tutorial sessions and analytical skills 
during the laboratories from lecturers. You are encouraged to draw upon these sources of 
feedback to enhance your learning. In particular, students will receive feedback through:
●Group feedback via informal quizzes during lectures
●Group and individual feedback via problem–solving tasks in tutorials
●Individual and group mentoring in laboratory classes and the design project
●Written individual feedback through the class test
