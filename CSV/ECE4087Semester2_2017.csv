Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit provides an introduction to the process of design and innovation with particular reference 
to medical technology. The design, development and manufacture of medical technology are 
covered, taking into consideration safety and effectiveness issues, regulatory and legal issues, the 
patient equipment interface and the hospital or medical environment in which the equipment is to 
be used. This will be achieved through case studies and development of a business plan.
Mode of delivery

The unit consists of lectures introducing students to medical technology design and issues relating 
to its development and commercialization. Guest lecturers and research staff from the medical 
technology industry will present Australian medical technology case studies Students will be 
required to participate in workshops where group work will enable them to develop new design 
concepts and investigate issues relating to these designs. Workshops will also provide a forum for 
these design concepts to be presented and critiqued. In these workshops the main learning 
approach is “Problem-based learning” which requires students to be involved with a hypothetical 
design and innovation project and to be proactive learners.

Assessment title: Assessment Task 1: Individual Medical technology innovation context – 
investigation of childhood disability.
 Through weekly workshops Mode of delivery:
Details of task:  Length: 3000 word report & group presentation.Details of task:
In the context of designing a new item of assistive technology for disabled children, students are 
required to research disease and disability related to children. Students will use available library 
reference material to produce a report that classifies childhood disability and its prevalence. This 
research will provide a context for subsequent workshop and assignment work dealing with the 
design of assistive technology.

essay.
High Distinction
The essay shows clear evidence of critical analysis, and reflection on the texts that were reviewed. 
There is a broad range of original and personal insights into the work of this author or illustrator or 
of the genre of Indigenous literature for children. Quality professional reading is evident and this is 
used to enrich the discussion and critique of the reviewed work. Familiarity with a wide range of 
the reviewed texts is evident. All assignment-writing requirements are met to the highest standard 
(eg presentation, coherency, spelling, referencing, and grammar).
Distinction
The essay shows clear evidence of critical analysis and reflection on the texts that were reviewed. 
There is some original thinking evident in the discussion. Professional reading on this topic or 
person is used to enrich the discussion. Familiarity with a range of the reviewed texts is evident. All 
assignment-writing requirements are of a very good standard (presentation, coherency, spelling, 
referencing, and grammar).
Credit
The essay is focused on description although there is some attempt to critically analyse the texts 
which were reviewed. Professional reading on the topic or the person is evident but limited in 
scope and quality. While the discussion shows that there is a good understanding of the chosen 
topic, there is a lack of originality of thinking. Guidelines for assignment writing have been met at a 
satisfactory standard.
Pass
Overall, the essay is focused on description with scant evidence of critical analysis or reflection. 
The discussion reveals a limited understanding of the elements involved in the creation of children’
s literature or illustrations (Topic 1) or of quality indigenous literature for children (Topic 2). There is 
little evidence of professional reading on the chosen topic. Guidelines for assignment writing have 
been met at the satisfactory level.

Due dates and extensions
The due dates for the submission of assignments are given in the previous section. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
 the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificate.before
The form should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, sent to the unit coordinator. The 
email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in lieu of signature.
Note that other lecturers cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in-charge (unit coordinator) will indicate 
at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the submitted work.
If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assignment.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
