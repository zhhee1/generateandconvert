Section A: For Clayton students
Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.
Not meant to be filled in by staff.
Teaching and learning method
Lecture and tutorials or problem classes, computer laboratory-based classes, and case-based 
teaching.
Students are to gain the ability to model elementary electro-mechanical systems, incorporating 
mechanical and electrical energy exchange and interaction, with additional instruction on common 
applied mathematical methods used in electromechanical system analysis, including Laplace 
transforms and complex algebra. This will be conveyed through lectures and learning materials 
provided. Practice classes will provide the student reinforced understanding of the topics taught. 
The computing laboratory is meant to facilitate flip-based learning in which students will have 
freedom to explore on their own on how to best utilize computers (through Matlab programming) to 
solve circuit problems, as well as to interface with sensors and actuators. Introductory Matlab 
programming lessons will be given.
Tutorial allocation
There are 2-hours of practice classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 2. Students 
must enroll in one practice class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular 
practice class will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit 
coordinator. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence 
is shown that timetabling means that is the only session possible.
Computing laboratory allocation
There is no formal allocation for this component. Each week, commencing from week 2 and ending 
in week 9, a computing venue is booked for 2 hours for students to consult designated tutors for 
help. Beyond that, students are to make their own arrangements to use the computing facilities 
available in the faculty.
Communication, participation and feedback
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing

The engineering discipline expects to produce graduates, who are: Mechanical Engineering 
1. competent in engineering Mechanical Engineering 
2. responsible and effective global citizens
3. leaders in their chosen profession or society at large.
Program Outcomes
Theengineering discipline has developed a set of Program Outcomes  Mechanical Engineering 
(POs) for all of its graduates based on the competencies required by the Malaysian Engineering 
Accreditation Council.
Program Outcomes (POs)Activities used in this unit to develop POs, 
achievement of Bloom’s domains and complex 
problem solving
PO1Engineering  Mechanical Engineering 
 Apply knowledge of Knowledge:

problem solving approaches and discussions 
with individual students.
PO2  Identify, formulate, Problem Analysis:
survey research literature and analyse 
complexengineering  Mechanical Engineering 
problems reaching substantiated conclusions 
using first principles of mathematics, natural 
sciences and engineering sciences
Cognitive: In order to be able to identify, 
formulate, analyse and solve relevant complex 
engineering problems, in problem solving 
classes, questions are framed in an 
engineering context, rather than a 
mathematical one. Thus, the first step is to 
determine which techniques are required to 
solve the problems. Initially, this can be 
challenging for students and so considerable 
support is provided during problem solving 
classes. On the basis of past experience this 
is usually the most difficult aspect of the unit 
for students. At the problem solving classes 
the academics will illustrate the approach to 
framing a problem and how the theory taught 
is incorporated into it.
PO3  Design/Development of Solutions:
Design solutions for complex Mechanical 
engineering problems and Engineering 
design systems, components or processes 
that meet specified needs.

Teaching and learning method
Students are to gain the ability to model elementary electro-mechanical systems, incorporating 
mechanical and electrical energy exchange and interaction, with additional instruction on common 
applied mathematical methods used in electromechanical system analysis, including Laplace 
transforms and complex algebra. This will be conveyed through lectures and learning materials 
provided. Practice classes will provide the student reinforced understanding of the topics taught.   
Tutorial allocation
There are 3-hours of practice classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 2. Students 
must enroll in one practice class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular 
practice class will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit 
coordinator. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence 
is shown that timetabling means that is the only session possible.
Pneumatic system laboratory exercise
This exercise will commence in Week 9 and end in Week 10. Due to limited pneumatic system 
trainers, groups of students have to take turn to complete this practical exercise. Laboratory 
manual will be available at Moodle in Week 8.   
Communication, participation and feedback
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice 
classes, individual feedback, verbal and written feedback, discussions in class, as well as more 
formal feedback related to assignment marks and grades. 
Learning outcomes
Students are to gain the ability to model elementary electro-mechanical systems, incorporating 
mechanical and electrical energy exchange and interaction, with additional instruction on common

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
