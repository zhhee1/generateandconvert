Teaching and learning method
The unit consists of lectures, laboratory and practice/tutorial classes. Learning in the unit is mainly 
through problem solving in practice/tutorial and laboratory classes and private study.
There is 1-hour of practice/tutorial and 2-hours of laboratory classes scheduled each week.
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice

feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice 
classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, 
discussions in class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment marks and grades. 
Students/You are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their/your learning.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Hurdle requirements 
The unit coordinator reserves the right to moderate the assessments given by the individual tutors. 
This process will occur at the end of the semester.
To achieve an overall pass grade: (i) the overall mark must exceed 50% and (ii) a mark of at least 
45% in both the total of “Continuous Assessments” (i.e., cumulated mark >13.5/30) and in the 
“Final Examination” ” (i.e. final exam mark >31.5/70).

Extensions and penalties
Due dates and extensions
The due dates for the submission of assignments are given in the previous section. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificate.before 
sent to the unit coordinator. The The form should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, 
email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in lieu of signature.
Note that other lecturers cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in-charge (unit coordinator) will indicate 
at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the submitted work.
If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assignment.
Late assignment
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
the work, but 10% of the total marks available for that assessment component will usually be 
deducted for each day late.
No assignment will be accepted once an assignment has been returned to the class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assignments to safeguard 
against the loss of work through accident or error.
Returning assignments
Return dates
Students can expect assignments to be returned within two weeks of the submission date or after 
receipt, whichever is later.
Assessment for the unit as a whole is in accordance with the provisions of the Monash University 
ECE4042 Communications theory - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,

Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.
If Electronic Submission has been approved for your unit, use Moodle for submission.
Remember that, just as for hard copy submissions, you should arrange your study /workload so as 
to allow plenty of time for last minute hitches. Computer problems/ busy servers will  NOT be an 
excuse for an extension. Do not leave electronic submission of your assignment to the last minute.

Feedback to you 
The assessment methods in this unit have been designed to deliver accurate feedback as soon as 
possible to facilitate effective learning process. Please make the best use of the feedback 
mechanism by clarifying and asking more questions when the feedback are given.
●Laboratory sessions: Tutors are available to answer your questions. Comments given to you 
at the end of the laboratory session are meant to help you shape a better understanding of 
the topic and improve the quality of your laboratory assignments. Further queries may be 
raised during the tutorial sessions for clarification.
●Tutorial: Work solutions are available. The lecturer/tutor will explain in detail upon request 
during the tutorial sessions.
●Mid-semester test: One of the most important feedback mechanism preparing you for the 
final examination and identify current weakness in understanding. Pay attention to the 
discussion/review session after the test.
●All written works submitted for assessment will be returned within 2 weeks of submission.
