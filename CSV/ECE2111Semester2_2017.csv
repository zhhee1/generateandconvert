Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit provides foundations for the electrical engineering areas of control, signal processing and 
communications. The unit introduces concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, their 
sampling and aliasing issues. Complex numbers, in particular, complex exponentials are 
introduced along with their representation as phasors, leading to periodic waveforms, Fourier 
series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described using FIR 
filters, discrete-time systems, the unit-sample response, discrete convolution, linear time-invariant 
systems, convolution integrals, the continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-
frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram, and Laplace Transform. Connecting frequency 
response and time response completes the unit.

Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.

Teaching and learning method
The unit uses the following teaching approaches:
●Lectures
●Tutorials/problem classes
●Laboratory-based classes
The lectures are intended to present key aspects of the material in the unit, including motivating 
and introducing theory, working through examples, discussing applications of the ideas presented 
in engineering applications. Lectures will incorporate active learning strategies. Tutorials provide 
students with an opportunity to work on problems, and gain feedback on their progress in solving 
those problems. The aim of the problems is to help students improve and reinforce their 
understanding of the unit material, and practice demonstrating the unit outcomes. The laboratory 
classes are aimed to help students connect the theory with more practical problems, and 
develop skills in programming, and using simulation tools.
Learning outcomes
On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
1. Analyse and manipulate continuous-time and discrete-time signals using appropriate 
techniques.
2. Evaluate and analyse signals in frequency and time domains.
3. Analyse engineering systems by applying linear time invariant system concepts.
4. Apply the Fourier transform, Laplace Transform, and the discrete Fourier transforms to 
signals and system problems.
5. Recognise sampling errors and aliasing phenomena.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

conflicting 
requirements (RoR)
Involve wide-ranging or conflicting technical, engineering and 
other issues

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
