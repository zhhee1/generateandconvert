Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit aims to develop an understanding of the structure and operation of electrical power 
systems using different resources, and considering their environmental impacts. It covers current 
and future energy scenarios for the world and Australia. This requires an understanding of the 
basic concepts and modelling of electrical power systems, including techniques for power flow and 
fault analysis, control of voltage, frequency, harmonic distortion, and system stability. Methods are 
presented to identify and clear faults, maximise power system economy and estimate the capital 
cost as well as unit price of electricity ($/kWh) using various energy conversion technologies.

PE3.5 Ability to function effectively as an 
individual and in multidisciplinary and 
multicultural teams, as a team leader or 
manager as well as an effective team member
Laboratory experiment experience
Teaching and learning method
The unit consists of lectures, laboratory practice and tutorial classes. Laboratories and tutorials will 
be of 3-hour duration. Students are required to complete prescribed preliminary work for each 
laboratory experiment. The purpose of a tutorial is to resolve any difficulties that students might 
have encountered while attempting to solve prescribed tutorial problems. It is essential that 
students do attempt to solve problems prior to attending tutorials.
Tutorial and laboratory allocation
Students must enrol in a practice class only using Allocate+. Students not allocated to a particular 
practice class will not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit 
coordinator. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence 
is shown that timetabling means that is the only session possible. 
Learning outcomes
To understand energy conversion technologies, electric power system modelling, power flow 
analysis faults in power systems electrical grid power and frequency control power stability and 
quality of supply economy of electric power systems.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

High Distinction
The assignment report shows clear evidence of critical analysis, and reflection on the experimental 
results obtained. There is a broad range of insights into the work performed. Quality professional 
understanding is evident and this is used to enrich the discussion and critique of the reported work. 
Familiarity with the subject matter is evident. All assignment-writing requirements are met to the 
highest standard in terms of presentation, coherency, spelling, referencing, grammar etc.
Distinction
The report shows clear evidence of critical analysis and reflection on the experimental assignment 
results obtained. There is some original thinking evident in the discussion. Professional 
understanding of the topic is shown in the discussion. Familiarity with the subject matter is evident. 
All assignment-writing requirements are met to the highest standard in terms of presentation, 
coherency, spelling, referencing, grammar etc.
Credit
The  report is focused on the experiment description although there is some attempt to assignment
critically analyse the results obtained. Professional approach to the topic is evident but the report is 
limited in scope and quality. The discussion shows that there is a fair understanding of the subject 
matter. Guidelines for assignment writing have been met at a satisfactory standard.
Pass
Overall, the report is focused on description with scant evidence of critical analysis or assignment 
reflection. The discussion reveals a limited understanding of the experiment. There is little 
evidence of professional reading on the chosen topic. Guidelines for assignment writing have been 
met at the satisfactory level.

 Additional remarks:
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
the work, but 10% of the total marks available for that assessment component will usually be 
deducted for each day late. 
No assignment will be accepted once an assignment has been returned to the class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assignments to safeguard 
against the loss of work through accident or error. 
Students can expect assignments to be returned within two weeks of the submission date or after 
receipt, whichever is later.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
Referencing requirements
The University regards most seriously any acts of dishonesty in assessment such as plagiarism, 
collusion, resubmission of previously marked work in different units, examination misconduct and 
theft of other students’ work.
 PlagiarismWhile some people incorrectly assume that plagiarism occurs only where someone 
copies verbatim, it really involves taking and using another person’s ideas or work and passing 
these off as one’s own by failing to give appropriate acknowledgement; that is, not indicating by 
referencing that the ideas expressed are not your own. Good scholarship is marked by an 
acknowledgement of the origin of ideas you use, develop or synthesise.
 Collusion(or unauthorised collaboration) Means joint effort in preparing material submitted for 
assessment, between students or others, except where this has been approved by the lecturer-in-
charge of the unit.
 CheatingMeans seeking to obtain an unfair advantage in an examination or in other written or 
practical work required to be submitted or completed by a student for assessment. Hence, if the 
passing off was done intentionally you have cheated, if it was not intentional, the offence you have 
committed is the academic misdemeanor of failing to reference a source correctly.
Acts of dishonesty in assessment could result in penalties, including failure in the unit and possible 
exclusion from the University. For further details please refer to the University’s Discipline Statute 
(Statute 4.1).
University statements on plagiarism are contained in the University Discipline Statute 4.1 at: 
http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/calendar/statutes/Statute04.html and accompanying guidelines 
at: http://www.adm.monash.edu.au/unisec/academicpolicies/policy/plagiarism.html and http://www.
