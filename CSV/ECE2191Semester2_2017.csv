Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit will introduce fundamental concepts of probability theory applied to engineering problems 
in a manner that combines intuition and mathematical precision. The treatment of probability 
includes elementary set operations, sample spaces and probability laws, conditional probability, 
independence, and notions of combinatorics. A discussion of discrete and continuous random 
variables, common distributions, functions, and expectations forms an important part of this unit. 
Transform methods, limit theorems, convergences, and bounding techniques are also covered. 
Special consideration is given to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Markov 
chain, transition probabilities and steady state distribution will be discussed.
Application examples from engineering, science, and statistics will be provided: The Gaussian 
distribution in source and channel coding, the exponential, Chi-square, and Gamma distributions in 
wireless communications and Bayesian statistics, the Rayleigh distribution in wireless 
communications, the Cauchy distribution in detection theory, the Poisson and Erlang distributions 
in traffic engineering, queuing theory and networking, the Gaussian, Laplacian and generalised 
Gaussian distributions in image processing, the Weibull distribution in high voltage engineering 
and electrical insulation, Markov chain in queuing theory, and first-order Markov process in 
predictive speech/image compression.

Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

Teaching and learning method
The unit consists of lectures and tutorial classes. Learning in the unit is mainly through lectures 
and working on the tutorial problem sets and assignments, which consist of a wide range of 
problems. By working on different types of problems, students will develop a deeper understanding 
to the subject materials.
Tutorial allocation

Tutorial allocation
There are 2-hours of practice classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 1. Students 
must enroll in the practice class using Allocate Plus.
Communication, participation and feedback
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice 
classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, 
discussions in class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment marks and grades. 
Students are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their learning.
Teaching Approach
Lectures: The lectures will be delivered using a set of lecture notes. Electronic version of these 
notes will be available on Moodle site of this unit.
Tutorials: In tutorials you will work on problem sets under the guidance of a tutor. Electronic 
version of the problem set will be available on Moodle.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
