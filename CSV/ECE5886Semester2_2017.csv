Unit handbook information
Synopsis
The Smart Grid unit provides a comprehensive knowledge about the Smart Grid and how it is to be 
operated and protected for improving sustainability and energy savings. The core of the unit is 
intelligent infrastructure for Smart Grid and its heightening vulnerability, and how to protect it 
effectively.
The basic economic fundamentals of power systems and conventional and renewable power 
generation in regulated and deregulated environment are introduced first. The basic concepts of 
intelligent control, application of intelligent agents in grid technology, and intelligent components 
commonly used in Smart Grids are extensively discussed afterward. Also included is how 
distribution networks adapt to intermittent energy sources (e.g. solar and wind) through the use of 
smart grids, emerging technologies and energy storage systems.
The unit will conclude with defining concept, design and purpose of the Smart Grid, reviewing 
current and relevant technologies developed, assessing its vulnerabilities to a cyber-attack, and 
finding effective protective mechanisms for the grid.

Section A: For Clayton students
Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 2 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 2 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 2 competencies are relevant to each unit.
Stage 1 competenciesActivities used in this unit to develop stage 1 
competencies
PE1.1 Knowledge of science and 
engineering fundamentals
Theoretical lecture material, tutorial sessions, and 
lab session. 
PE1.2 In-depth technical competence in 
at least one engineering discipline​
Appropriately chosen tutorial and lab tasks.
PE1.3 Techniques and resources​The laboratory sessions and lecture notes provide 
a broad understanding of smart power grids. 
Students are also made aware of relevant tools for 
analysis and design of engineering systems.
PE1.4 General knowledge​This unit focuses on specialised smart power 
grids knowledge.
PE2.1 Ability to undertake problem 
identification, formulation, and solution​
Particularly addressed in laboratory tasks.
PE2.2 Understanding of social, cultural, 
global, and environmental responsibilities 
and the need to employ principles of 
sustainable development​
Basically, sustainable development is a main focus 
of this unit in general via developing smart grids 
technologies.
PE2.3 Ability to utilise a systems 
approach to complex problems and to 
design and operational performance​
Talking various components, this unit discusses 
designing complex power smart grids.
PE2.4 Proficiency in engineering design​Laboratory experiments/assignment tasks require 
the students to consider various engineering and 
non-engineering factors.

Relationship between OBE Learning Outcomes (LOs) and 
assessments
Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
