Teaching approach
In the first week of the semester there will be just three one-hour lectures. For the remainder of the 
semester (weeks 2 to 12) there will be three one-hour lectures plus one two hour tutorial (also 
known as a support, practice or laboratory class). Lectures will be recorded and will be available 
online through the Echo 360 Learning Capture system. Every effort will be made to ensure that all 
lectures are recorded but on rare occasions technical issues may cause the recording to 
fail. Students are expected to attend one 2-hour support class per week during weeks 2 to 12 of 
the semester. The support classes are intended to help students gain mastery of the material by 
 working through set exercises with the assistance of other students and the class tutor.
 
Feedback to you
We will provide feedback in a number of ways, including
Assignments an quizzes.
Always look through the marked assignments and quizzes, and read the comments given by your 
tutor either written on the assignment itself or in class to the whole group. Always ask if there is 
something that it is not clear to you. All topics included in the assignments will be covered in the 
final exam, therefore it is important that if you lost marks in a particular question that you find out 
what you did wrong to avoid making the same mistake again in the exam!
Tutorials.
Tutorials are the best place to get feedback from both the tutor and your peers. Take the weekly 
problem sets seriously, and clarify anything that you are unsure about. Many questions included in 
the problem sets are from previous exams and they will give you an idea of what will be included in 
your exam.
Assistance outside scheduled classes.
You can always seek help from the tutors in the Mathematics Learning Centre, located in room 
G24, 9 Rainforest Walk (Building 28). The MLC is open from 11am to 2pm Monday to Friday from 
week 2 until the end of exams in each semester.
Sample exam.
Towards the end of the semester a sample exam, with solutions, will be released on Moodle. Work 
through the exam, and check through the solutions only once you finished your attempt.

It is strongly recommended that students take a copy of the final version of their assignments prior 
to its submission, for example with their phone or using a scanner. Note: Some support classes 
. Students in these classes will be allowed to hand their assignment will fall on public holidays
either to the unit-coordinator or to any tutor . Student's with quizzes before the public holiday
scheduled for a public holiday will have their mark for that quiz computed as the average for their 
remaining quizzes.
Students who have attempted this unit previously must complete all assessment tasks again. No 
marks can be carried across from a previous enrolment in the unit.
Assignments and quizzes.
There will be five assignments each worth 6% plus five quizzes each worth 2% (for a total of 40%). 
The quizzes will be run during the support class and will take about 20 minutes to complete.
In order to get full marks for the assignments you must not only get the correct answer (what a

In order to get full marks for the assignments you must not only get the correct answer (what a 
surprise) you will also be expected to provide clear explanations as to how you arrived at your 
answers. You will need to use, where appropriate, proper English sentences (this does not include 
sms, txt or emojis) and you should employ correct mathematical terminology and pay due care to 
how you present your answers. Marks will be deducted for sloppy presentations. 
Examples of what we expect (and examples of what we hope never to see) can be found on the 
unit web site.
You are not required to use a word processor to prepare your assignments. Neat hand written 
submissions will be perfectly acceptable.
Assignment submission.
There is only one way to submit your assignments for this unit: you must hand them to your tutor 
. The submission dates are clearly during your tutorial in the week that the assignment is due
stated on each assignment. All five assignments will be available at least two weeks before the 
due date. This should give every student ample opportunity to complete each assignment by the 
due date.
If you have any reason why you are unable to submit your assignment by the due date you must 
contact your campus coordinator  the due date. In all other cases late penalties will apply as before
set out in the Faculty of Science policy (see below).
Assignments submitted by e-mail will not be accepted.
Assignment cover sheet. In accordance with school and university policy, all assignments must 
include a signed cover sheet. The School of Mathematical Sciences cover sheet can be 
downloaded from the unit website on Moodle. For Clayton students, hard copies of cover sheets 
are often available from the School Enquiries Office on the fourth floor of the mathematics building 
(near the lifts).
Submitting late assignments. The Faculty of Science has a strict policy on late submission of work. 
It stipulates that late assignments will normally be penalised at 10% of the maximum mark per 
calendar day until one week after the due date, after which a zero mark is awarded. Note in 
particular the use of . This means that all seven days of the week, including holidays, calendar days
will be used when counting how many days have lapsed after the due date. It is part of your 
learning experience at Monash to properly plan your time to meet the given deadlines.
If you know in advance that you may have difficulty in meeting a deadline please contact your 
campus coordinator as soon as possible  the due date. Only in exceptional circumstances before
will extensions be given  the due date has passed.after
Tutors are  to approve extensions to deadlines.not authorised

Return of marked work. Where possible marked assessments will be returned to you at your next 
support class following the week in which the assessment was due. Your marks will also be posted 
on the Grade Book on Moodle at around the same time and you should check these have been 
recorded correctly. If any of them have been entered incorrectly you must query them with your 
tutor in a timely manner. (If work is consistently being handed back late to you, or your marks are 
not posted on Moodle within a week of receiving your marked work, please advise the Unit 
Coordinator.) If you are unable to collect your work at the usual class, please ask your tutor at the 
next class. Any uncollected work after the end of semester can be retrieved from the Unit 
Coordinator up until the end of the examination period.
If you believe that an error has been made in the marking of any assessment, for example missed 
working or a mistake in the addition, you should discuss that with your tutor initially. If you are not 
satisfied with their response you should contact your campus coordinator to arrange a meeting.
Examination(s)
The final exam will run for three hours and will contain between 8 and 12 questions. Each question 
may contain many parts. A sample exam with solutions will be made available on the unit web site 
during the semester.
No calculators, textbooks or notes of any kind will be allowed in the exam. A basic formula sheet 
will be provided with the exam and a copy will be available on the unit web site later in the 
semester.
The final unit mark will be sum of the marks for works submitted during the semester, worth a total 
of 40%, and the final exam, worth 60%.
Students are required to achieve at least 45% in the total continuous assessment component and 
at least 45% in the final examination component and an overall mark of 50% to achieve a pass 
grade in the unit. Students failing to achieve this requirement will be given a maximum of 45% in 
the unit.
 
Applications for special consideration
Students with a valid reason for late submission of an assignment must show the Chief Examiner 
the originals (and provide a copy) of appropriate documentation within two working days of the 
normal deadline for that piece of work. This application must be submitted directly to the Chief 
Examiner in room 317 (or slip them under the door if there is nobody in the office at that time). The 
Chief Examiner will advise you of the outcome of the application by email.

Revision2
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
In 2017 there will be five mini-quizzes introduced in the sport classes. This was a common request 
from the SETU surveys of 2016.

Lecture notes.
Detailed lecture notes will be available only in PDF form through Moodle. Printed notes will not be 
provided. All unit information, assignments, exercises, marks and all announcements will be made 
available through Moodle. Lectures will be recorded and will be available online through the Echo 
360 Learning Capture system. Every effort will be made to ensure that all lectures are recorded but 
on rare occasions technical issues may cause the recording to fail.
Support classes.
Support classes (also known as laboratory classes and tutorials) will begin in week 2 and run 
through to week 12 (i.e., a total of 11 support classes). Each class will run for 2 hours during which 
time students will have the opportunity to work on set exercises, to discuss problems and solutions 
with other students and to seek assistance from the tutor.
Students will be allocated to one of the support classes by a program known as . This Allocate+
can be accessed from the web page . Note that changes http://www.monash.edu/timetables/login
to your allocated supported class can only be made by you (the unit coordinator can not make 
). Changes can be made through the  web page and will be changes on your behalfAllocate+
accepted only in the first two weeks of the semester.
Mathematics learning centre.
The School of Mathematical Sciences also operates a Mathematics Learning Centre, to provide 
additional assistance to students who are encountering difficulties with lecture material and 
exercises in any of their first and second-year mathematics units (including ENG1005).
The Mathematics Learning Centre (MLC) is located in Room G24 on the ground floor of Building 
28 at the Clayton campus and it is open from week 2 to the end of exams daily from 11am--2pm.
