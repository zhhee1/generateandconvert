Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit develops a process for the analysis and design of static and dynamic structures and 
mechanisms using engineered materials. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the fundamentals 
of mechanical, civil and material engineering will be explained and the basic concepts of loads and 
motions are introduced.
Team-based projects will highlight the multidisciplinary nature of modern engineering. These 
concepts will be practised through hands-on projects carried out by teams. Communication and 
teamwork skills will be developed through teamwork tasks.

If you have a question, please first consult the course unit guide and also check if the issue was 
covered in class. Then the most efficient way to contact us is to ask us in person in one of the 
practical classes, during or after a workshop or at the weekly help desk sessions. We generally 
find that a "real-time" face-to-face discussion is more efficient than back-and-forth email. This also 
helps us to get know students better.  However, there are some issues that are obviously best 
handled by email, in which case please contact us only at the following course email address and 
not through the addresses of the individual instructors:
Email:    ENG1001.clayton-x@monash.edu
This email account will be monitored by all Lecturers and Lead Tutors, and will enable us to 
resolve your issues in a timely and consistent manner.  If you send us an email outside of regular 
working hours, please be patient. While we can't guarantee a quick reply at those times, you'll 
likely find that we’re often online as much as you are.
You will also periodically receive notices and announcements posted through Moodle related to 
this unit via email to your monash student email address.  If you wish to respond to these you must

Teaching and learning method
In this unit, formal contact hours consist of workshop/lectures and practice classes. A “flipped 
classroom” approach is adopted, whereby  short videos and online quizzes be watched and must 
completed prior to the relevant lecture/workshop.
ENG1001 Engineering design: Lighter, faster, stronger - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (7) Break----------------

completed prior to the relevant lecture/workshop.
Learning in the unit is through multiple methods consisting of:
●pre-workshop videos and/or readings with an online quiz assessment
●Workshops with associated worksheets which are assessed.
●practical class activities which will develop key skills and knowledge required for the major 
projects, and develop teamwork skills.
●completing private study questions throughout the semester
Lecture/Workshop class allocation
Each student must enrol in and attend one of the two available 2-hour Workshop classes each and 
every week, using Allocate Plus. These workshop classes will be taught in a Lecture theatre, and 
will be a mix of presentations from the lecturer and active learning. Due to class size limitations 
students MUST attend their allocated workshop, and cannot opt to attend whichever stream they 
prefer. Each workshop stream will be exactly the same and taught by the same staff. Where 
possible we will select project teams to try and ensure that team members are scheduled for the 
same workshop stream.
Practical class allocation
Each student must enrol in and attend one of the four available 3-hour practice classes scheduled 
each week using Allocate Plus. These commence in Week 1 and run every week. Project teams 
will be selected by the instructors within each of the different practical classes. Students who do 
not enrol in a particular practice class, or do so late may be moved to a different class to balance 
project team numbers. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless 
MUTTS evidence is provided, clearly showing your clash, and evidence of attempts to 
rescheduling your other class. In these cases we will work to try and resolve your issues but offer 
no guarantees. Sadly we cannot reschedule you based on work or other commitments outside 
of university unless special consideration is awarded.
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:
1. Identify different structural systems (e.g. beams and trusses) and translate physical 
structures into appropriate models for analysis and design.
2. Determine forces acting in simple beams and truss systems using free body diagrams and 
rigid body equilibrium.
3. Determine internal axial and bending stresses in beams, struts and/or trusses structures 
and select appropriately sized members.
4. Determine the motion of particles and rigid bodies using fundamental concepts of 
kinematics and kinetics.
5. Determine the motion of particles and rigid bodies using energy methods.
6. Describe the key properties of structural materials for specific applications.
7. Describe, determine and summarise the importance of the microstructure of materials and 
analyse the microstructure-property relationship.
8. Describe how different material processing routes directly influence material structural 
properties.
9. Function as part of a team and communicate effectively with team members to prepare

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●Help desks will be run on two separate days to allow more flexibility for students to attend.
●Fewer marks deducted from Worksheets for minor errors.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
●Best aspect was the inclusion of the hands on experience of building and constructing stuff
●Weekly worksheets were a good way to keep up to date
●Online videos are a much better way to teach than lectures

 Additional remarks:
*CATME Online Peer Assessment:
The CATME online peer assessment tool will be used to allow team members to anonymously rate 
the contributions made to each team project by both themselves and their team mates. Students 
will be required to complete a calibration process which demonstrates how the system should be 
used. At the conclusion of each major project they will then rate themselves and their teammates 
on the basis of five key criteria, and using a behaviourally anchored scale. The individual ratings 
you give each person are not viewable or shared with other team members, but will be reviewed 
by the teaching staff. You will be asked to justify (via comments) why you rated particular people 
high or low. You are NOT allowed to simply rate everyone the same, or have your team all give 
each member the same ratings. This will incur a automatic -10% penalty if you do so.
Based on these ratings a Peer Assessment Factor will be calculated by the system for each team 
member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the written 
comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.1, but for the vast majority of 
student in well functioning teams, it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be returned 
confidentially to students via Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an individual mark 
for each student’s project work, based on their team’s mark for each of the major team projects.
Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow them to see, for 
each of the five questions an arrow indicating:
1. how they scored themselves;
2. the AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
3. the AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members
CATME will also provide detailed suggestions for improvement based on where your results fall 
relative to the rest of the team. For more information please visit this link: http://info.catme.org/
 
Assessment title: Materials Assignment
 Consult Moodle for detailsMode of delivery:
Details of task: The Materials team assignment comprises two parts: processing and interpreting 
the results of data obtained from a tensile test undertaken in one of the practical classes in weeks 
4 or 5 and carrying out a material selection design.

 On campus Mode of delivery:
Details of task: The continuous assessment grades obtained for the two major projects and 
Materials assignment undertaken in ENG1001, totalling 42% of the continuous assessment mark, 
.  cannot be carried forward in subsequent enrolment and assessment
Students in the following categories will be required to repeat all project and practice class work:
●Students that received less than an average of 0.8 for their CATME peer assessment factors 
in their previous semester, indicating they did not contribute  equally to the projects,
●Students that withdrew from the unit before its completion
Students that completed the unit previously with average CATME peer assessment factors greater 
than or equal to 0.8, and only failed the exam hurdle, may opt for the following alternative 
assessment, in place of the projects and materials assignment: 
●2 x 1.5 hour closed book tests, each worth 21% of the continuous assessment mark, one 
running mid semester and the other at the end of semester.
●The first test will  cover the engineering disciplines of Civil and Materials Engineering, and 
the second test  Mechanical Engineering, both tests covering material presented prior to the 
test times. 
●You will  be allocated to teams and do  need to attend weekly practice classes.  You notnot
may, however, come and seek extra help with your test preparation.
●To confirm the test marks will take the place of previously obtained project and assignment 
marks.

Teaching and learning method
In this unit, formal contact hours consist of workshop/lectures and practice classes. A “flipped 
classroom” approach is adopted, whereby  short videos and online quizzes be watched and must 
completed prior to the relevant lecture/workshop.
Learning in the unit is through multiple methods consisting of:
●pre-workshop videos and/or readings with an online quiz assessment
●Workshops with associated worksheets which are assessed.
●practical class activities which will develop key skills and knowledge required for the major 
ENG1001 Engineering design: Lighter, faster, stronger - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (19) Break----------------
21
●practical class activities which will develop key skills and knowledge required for the major 
projects, and develop teamwork skills.
●completing private study questions throughout the semester
Lecture/Workshop class allocation
Each student must enroll in and attend the 3-hour Workshop class each and every week on 
Monday 9am - 12pm, using Allocate Plus. These workshop classes will be taught in a Lecture 
Theatre (5001), and will be a mix of presentations from the lecturer and active learning.
Practical class allocation
Each student must enroll in and attend one of the four available 3-hour practice classes scheduled 
each week using Allocate Plus. These commence in Week 1 and run every week. Project 
teamswill be selected by the instructors within each of the different practical classes. Students who 
do not enroll in a particular practice class, or do so late may be moved to a different class to 
balance project team numbers. Once a particular session is full, no more students will be 
accepted, unless Monash University Timetable System (MUTTS) evidence is provided, clearly 
showing your clash, and evidence of attempts to reschedule your other class. In these cases, we 
will work to try and resolve your issues but offer no guarantees. Sadly, we cannot reschedule you 
based on work orother commitments outside of university unless special consideration is awarded.
Email Communications
You may direct any questions or queries related to this unit lecturer at , vivi.anggraini@monash.edu
darwin.gouwanda@monash.edu  and pooria.pasbakhsh@monash.edu. Aside from in class 
announcements, you will also be periodically receiving notices and announcements related to this 
unit via email to your monash student email address.
Online Content:
Read selected unit material and watch the short videos which are both downloadable from Moodle. 
Videos are also accessible via YouTube. These materials will be used to communicate the 
fundamental information and background knowledge required for this subject. Moodle quizzes will 
be used to check your basic comprehension of this material, prior to the lecture/workshop.
Lecture/Workshops:
The scheduled lecture times will generally be used to conduct what we have termed ‘workshops’. 
These can be thought of as interactive and academic guided tutorials. Students will work on 
problems presented during the class. Students will be provided with a hand-out which we call a 
‘worksheet’, which features the information you require and room to complete each question. The 
lecturer and teaching assistants will periodically roam around the theatre to provide assistance 
during the working times. Students will be instructed to either complete activities on their own in 
silence or by working with the students immediately around them. Examples of student work will be 
discussed and reviewed, and students may be asked to comment or vote on questions etc. Some 
of the worksheet activities may have to be completed outside class of as homework tasks. It is the
responsibility of each student to complete these worksheets and have them checked off and 
receive feedback from a tutor at the Prac class the following week ONLY. Worksheets more than 2 
weeks old will no longer be able to be checked off. Completed worksheets must show your name 
ENG1001 Engineering design: Lighter, faster, stronger - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (20) Break----------------
22
weeks old will no longer be able to be checked off. Completed worksheets must show your name 
and will get a stamp and tutor initial on the front page. Marks are NOT recorded every week for 
worksheet completion. Students must keep all of their completed worksheets at least until Week12 
(a two-ring binder is highly recommended), at which point they will be counted by the tutors in the 
last Prac session and a single mark recorded based on the number of worksheets completed (and 
retained) by each student. Digital copies of the Worksheets will be made available on Moodle 
following the completion of the first stream of each workshop. Students which are sick or cannot 
attend any given Workshop will be required to download, print out and complete the relevant 
worksheet that they miss to obtain these marks. Extensions will only be given if a medical 
certificate is provided (digital copy of the medical certificate is acceptable).
 
Practicals:
Practicals will be utilised primarily for hands on labs/project work, team work and soft skills 
activities and group tensile tests. Nearly all Practical activities must be completed with your Project 
team, they cannot be done individually or with other random students. The practical activities must 
be completed and stamped by tutors at the conclusion of your prac time, however
they will generally be submitted (and marked) as a part of the two major projects. It is therefore 
critical that students and teams keep the hardcopy evidence of this work, and we also recommend 
that teams take a clear digital photo which can be provided in the case the original is lost or 
damaged. Worksheets questions and the worksheet summary page will be checked off and 
stamped by designated tutors (only) during these classes and some individual help with private 
study questions may be sought. The tutors may quiz you on the questions to check your 
understanding, or insist that you revise or have another attempt at certain questions before a sheet 
is stamped off. It is essential that students retain all their worksheets until the end of semester for 
final checking and allocation of your worksheet marks. We also advise students to keep 
photographic evidence of all
their stamped worksheets.
PASS sessions:
PASS sessions will run weekly starting from Week 2. Students can attend this session and receive 
assistance from senior undergraduate students as part of your private study. Private study 
questions can also be discussed. More information is available at http://www.monash.edu.au 
/students/pass-program/. Time and venues would be announced in Week 1 of the semester.
In a typical week, students are expected to:
● Read selected unit materials and watch online videos prior to attending lecture/workshop classes
. This will be assessed in a weekly  in Moodle.pre-lecture online quiz
● Attend lectures/workshops that focus on the application of the weekly discipline specific topics 
and examples. Participation at these Workshops will be assessed by completion of the 
Worksheets, which will be checked off weekly in the practical classes.
● Perform self-study to work their way through the private study problems. Solutions to these 
problems will be posted at the end of each week.

Hurdle requirements 
To pass the unit, students are required to achieve an overall mark of 50% and satisfy the following 
hurdle requirements:
●at least 45% in the  continuous assessment component (sum of Projects, quizzes, total
worksheets) AND
●at least 45% in the final examination component
Students failing to achieve these hurdle requirements will be given a maximum of 45% in the unit.
The unit coordinator reserves the right to moderate the assessments. This process will occur at the

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
ENG1001 Engineering design: Lighter, faster, stronger - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (27) Break----------------
29
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Students that completed the unit previously with average CATME peer assessment factors greater 
than or equal to 0.8, and only failed the exam hurdle, may opt for the following alternative 
assessment, in place of the projects and materials assignment: 
●2 x 1.5 hour closed book tests, each worth 21% of the continuous assessment mark, one 
running mid semester and the other at the end of semester.
●Each test will be related to the engineering disciplines (Civil, Materials, and Mechanical) 
covered in the 5 weeks previous to the tests.
●You will  be allocated to teams and do  need to attend weekly practice classes.  You notnot
may, however, come and seek extra help with your test preparation.
●To confirm the test marks will take the place of previously obtained project and assignment

  Hurdle requirements (where applicable): To pass the unit, students are required to achieve an 
overall mark of 50% and satisfy the following hurdle requirements:
●at least 45% in the continuous assessment component (sum of Projects, quizzes, total 
worksheets) AND
●at least 45% in the final examination component
Students failing to achieve these hurdle requirements will be given a maximum of 45% in the unit.
The unit coordinator reserves the right to moderate the assessments. This process will occur at the 
end of the semester.
CATME Online Peer Assessment:
The CATME online peer assessment tool will be used to allow team members to anonymously 
rate the contributions made to each team project by both themselves and their team mates. 
Students will be required to complete a calibration process which demonstrates how the system 
should be used. At the conclusion of each major project they will then rate themselves and their 
teammates on the basis of five key criteria, and using a behaviourally anchored scale. The 
individual ratings you give each person are not viewable or shared with other team members, but

----------------Page (32) Break----------------

individual ratings you give each person are not viewable or shared with other team members, but 
will be reviewed by the teaching staff. You will be asked to justify (via comments) why you rated 
particular people high or low. You are NOT allowed to simply rate everyone the same, or have 
your team all give each member the same ratings. This will incur a automatic -10% penalty if you 
do so.
Based on these ratings a Peer Assessment Factor will be calculated by the system for each 
team member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the 
written comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.1, but for the vast majority 
of student in well functioning teams, it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be 
returned confidentially to students via Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an 
individual mark for each student’s project work, based on their team’s mark for each of the major 
team projects. Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow 
them to see, for each of the five questions an arrow indicating:
1.how they scored themselves;
2.the AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
3.the AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members
CATME will also provide detailed suggestions for improvement based on where your results fall
relative to the rest of the team.

Each project team will be provided with a Project Kit for each of the major projects. Some of the 
items in these kits are considered ‘consumables’ and do not need to be returned at the conclusion 
of the project. Most parts however will need to be returned in good working condition, and these 
will be checked off by tutors. A cost will be incurred for any lost or damaged components. A list of 
replacement costs for each component will be provided with each kit. Project marks will be 
withheld from the whole team until such time as the cost of any lost or damaged components is 
paid, or the parts are replaced. Teams are responsible for sharing or recouping these costs
