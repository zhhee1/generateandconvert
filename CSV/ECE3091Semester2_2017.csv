Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit extends the level of complexity of electronic design by integrating and applying 
knowledge from a number of second year units. Students will use knowledge from linear and non-
linear electronics, computer engineering and communications engineering, to tackle a group 
project, applying project management skills, and extending their experience of working in groups. 
The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more 
complex, and less constrained situation. The project will be complemented by lectures in project 
management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written 
and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. 
Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.
Mode of delivery

this.
PE1.3 Techniques 
and resources
IT tools such as PCB designer, FPGA software, CAD tools, etc are widely 
adapted
PE1.4 General 
knowledge 
As well as thorough understanding the area of their contribution to the 
project they will also need to develop a general knowledge of the overall 
project structure and aims. Evaluation of risks and impact on society must 
be addressed in the design document. Ethical considertions regarding 
safety are a major concern in this design unit.
PE2.1 Ability to 
undertake 
problem 
identification, 
formulation, and 
solution​
The students are required to develop a requirements specification based 
on discussions with the supervisor and industrial partner (the "customer"). 
Possible solutions should be compared at an early stage. To develop an 
optimum solution, students are expected to cast the problem into an 
engineering formalism suitable for that sub-discipline, then apply 
approriate solution techniques. The students are expected to demonstrate 
that the solution satisfies the requirement specification be devising and 
conducting an appropriate test and evaluation regime and demonstrate

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
