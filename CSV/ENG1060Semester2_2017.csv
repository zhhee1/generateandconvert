Teaching and learning method
Lectures: The unit comprises 24 hours of lectures. The lectures are intended to introduce topics 
and to guide the student through the general principles and concepts required to use a computer 
to solve fundamental engineering problems. The class notes will be made available in electronic 
form through Moddle. These should be consulted and printed out prior to lectures. After the 
lectures, video recordings of the lectures can be downloaded from Moodle.
3-hour Computer Laboratories: In the computer laboratory classes, the students will have the 
opportunity to apply the material covered in previous lectures. Each lab consists of a number of 
exercises for students to solve using MATLAB, which is available at all Engineering Computer 
Labs.
Computer laboratory sessions are scheduled to run weekly. Students should allocate themselves

Computer laboratory sessions are scheduled to run weekly. Students should allocate themselves 
to a laboratory session through the Allocate+ system.
Students are also expected to study and revise for 7 hours every week
Laboratory allocation
There are 3 hours of laboratory classes scheduled each week, commencing in week 2. Students 
must enroll in a lab class only using Allocate Plus. Students not allocated to a particular class will 
not be accepted into that session without the written consent of the unit coordinator. Once a 
particular session is full, no more students will be accepted, unless evidence is shown that the 
student has a timetabling clash.
Communication, participation and feedback
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies.  In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via lab 
classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, 
discussions in class, online discussions as well as more formal feedback related to assignment 
marks and grades.  Students are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their 
learning.
You can also find information on inclusive teaching practices for students with learning disabilities 
or mental health conditions at:
http://www.monash.edu.au/lls/inclusivity/
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:
1. Identify appropriate MATLAB programming structures to solve simple computational tasks.
2. Identify and describe which numerical methods can be used to solve common engineering 
problems.
3. Construct short computer programs that implement these numerical methods.
4. Apply these numerical methods and programs to basic engineering problems.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Section C: All students 
Extensions and penalties
The due dates for the submission of assignments are given in previous sections. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48- hours 
such as medical certificate.before the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence 
The request should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, sent to the unit coordinator. 
The email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in lieu of 
signature.
Note that other lecturers cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in-charge (unit coordinator) will indicate 
at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the submitted work.
If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assignment.
Returning assignments
Assignments will be returned via Moodle
Resubmission of assignments
Resubmissions are explicitly allowed through Moodle until the due date.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
