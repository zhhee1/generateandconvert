Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit introduces students to the fundamental principles of some basic systems comprising of - 
Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic, Computing and Electro-mechanical sub-systems, with an 
intention to introduce cross-links between them for an integrated design approach towards their 
application to the development of complex systems.
Special emphasis will be made on introducing sub-systems required for - 'inception to completion' 
of mechatronic systems with practical design examples. The enabling sub-systems for integrated 
approach such as sensors and actuators, hardware interfacing, data acquisition for control and 
feedback of such systems, as well as strategies for risk assessment, interface definition, system 
integration, human integration, measurement and analysis as required in mechatronics product 
design & development will also be introduced.
This unit would outline the breadth of the knowledge that the mechatronics systems engineer must 
acquire regarding the features of diverse sub-systems and components that constitute the total 
system.

Teaching and learning method
●lecture and tutorials or problem classes; laboratory-based classes; case-based teaching; 
problem-based learning; work-integrated learning;
The unit consists of lectures and practice classes. Learning in the unit is mainly through lectures 
and the group project which goes for the whole semester and has a number of components which 
build to form the final project. The “Problem-based learning” is important in this unit, which requires 
students to be involved with the project and proactive learners. There are no right or wrong 
answers to some project questions. Some solutions will be better than others as they achieve the 
criteria in a better way.
Communication, participation and feedback

●Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via 
practice classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written 
feedback, discussions in class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment 
marks and grades. Students/You are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to 
enhance their/your learning.
Learning outcomes
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
1. describe what knowledge and skills are required to become a Mechatronics and Systems 
Engineer
2. interpret and classify cross-links and design interfaces required between subsystems of a 
system, both as hardware and software approach
3. map and define design specifications and solve unstructured problems
4. apply an integrated approach that can help design better and smarter products and 
processes
5. understand and implement basic tools and methods for system design.
6. review and conduct structured analysis of systems
7. plan, design and generate smart products and processes
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●This unit is now made an independent unit in Mechatronics, in order to make sure a full 
integration of the teaching materials and the associated project work.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
●The project work is interesting and practical.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
