Unit handbook information
Synopsis
Together with ECE4095 Project B, this unit is a challenging opportunity to pursue independently an 
individual project and is likely to require extended effort. The two units together normally include a 
preparatory literature survey and developmental work such as design, construction and 
programming. Students choose a project that interests them, and are assigned to a team of two 
supervising staff members.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●1. Maybe change the way the topics are allocated. It should be done in a more fair way. - 
This has been discussed at ECSE discipline meetings and the current system was adopted 
as it allows the freedom to choose a topic of their choice.  
●2. Increase the speed of the computers in FYP lab. 16GB RAM also not enough - An odd 
comment. Worstations provided should be really good for the most tasks at undergraduate 
level. If a student requires even faster workstation, the student should talk to the supervisor 
and could seek access to the HPC.  
● 3. The difficulty level of all projects should be similiar- Difficulty level should be comparable 
but it is very difficult to assess the degree of difficultiness as it is quite subjective.      
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
●The opportunity to work closely with a departmental academic on interesting and challenging 
projects.

Hurdle requirements 
At the end of Project A, students will present the results of their project to date. This will be in the 
form of a written progress report. If the supervisor and student are 
Should the supervisor (or student) have any concerns regarding progress to date, a panel of 
academics including the project supervisor and independent academics, to be determined by the 
unit coordinator, will interview the student(s) and assess the milestones and progress at which 
time the student(s) must defend their efforts and justify why the project should be allowed to 
continue.
The panel will take into consideration all of the required submissions in the Unit Schedule above. If 
the project is to continue the student will be notified via Moodle following the release of results 
according to faculty policy. As the project is only half complete at this stage, the official result for 
ECE4094 will indicate Result Withheld (WH) temporarily until the project is complete at the end of 
ECE4095 Project B.
In the event a project is not permitted to continue, the mid project review will record a fail against 
Project A ECE4094. A numerical mark will be returned based on the evidence presented to the 
mid point of the project for Project A only.  No mark will be recorded against ECE4095 for a project 
which fails to meet requirements at the end of ECE4094.
Students whose projects are not permitted to continue must dis-enrol from Project B and 
recommence a new project beginning with Project A ECE4094 in a subsequent semester.
The project is marked at its conclusion with consideration to the rubric posted under the unit 
moodle site.
Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
ECE4094 Project A - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (29) Break----------------
31
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Students may receive feedback in several ways:
●In response to weekly journal entries made by students placed on the Moodle page
●Through weekly contact with supervisors
●Through email discussion with supervisors or the unit coordinator
●Through oral discussions conducted in laboratories or places of testing and demonstration 
with their project supervisor
●Throggh direct oral interaction with the assessment panel
●Through written or oral comments associated with each milestone
Students will receive regular verbal feedback from their project supervisor. To facilitate this, 
students should hold regular meetings with their supervisor.

Feedback may take the form of advice, direction, suggestion or an indication that a task may or 
may not be to the satisfaction of the supervisor or unit coordinator.
Since the majority of projects are conducted with close association with a supervisor and there is 
significant opportunity for the student to meet with their supervisor on many occasions not all 
feedback will be documented. This unit provides a mechanism through direct weekly meetings, 
journal entries, presentations and impromptu meetings for students to gain significant feedback. 
Students are encouraged to document each meeting they have with their supervisor as part of 
their weekly journal. Failure to update the journal on a weekly basis may substantially limit the kind 
and type and delivery of feedback available. Students have a responsibility if they require feedback 
to ask for it at the time it is needed. There is of course no guarantee the feedback received will be 
to the students liking.
