Unit handbook information
Synopsis
The unit evaluates the propagation of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves in wireless and 
guided media using Maxwell's equations. The media covered include vacuum/air, radio frequency 
(RF) and microwave transmission lines, metallic waveguides, planar optical waveguides and 
optical fibres.
The unit also explores different types of antennas that can be used to generate the 
electromagnetic waves. In addition to these, the unit covers concepts related to electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Using these concepts, the unit 
explores practical problems such as interference and coupling in RF/microwave circuits and 
discusses solutions such as grounding, shielding and filtering. In each section of this unit, the 
learned theory is related to real-world applications to expand the understanding of students.

and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to the last SETU of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●Flipped Learning: Recorded lectures are available for students to watch before lectures. 
Students are advised to watch these and attempt relevant quizzes before attending lectures.
●Interactive Classes: Lectures will be delivered through interactive mode. Students will be 
asked questions and could also be asked to solve problems during lectures.
●Problem-based Practice Classes: Students will be asked to solve problems in each practical 
session. These sessions are used for assessment.
●Laboratory Classes/Design Project: Due to differences in facilities, the laboratory classes are 
different in Calyton and Malaysia. For this reason, the assessments based on these are also 
different. In Clayton, the following changes have been made:
●Sufficient time will be given to complete the design project. Please note the design 
projects use concepts learned in laboratories.
●The order of lecture topics have been changed to enable students to do design project 
better.
●Assessments: Students felt the marks allocated to continuous assessments are low. For this 
reason, the more marks have been given to continuous assessments in this offering.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
●Laboratory Sessions: The Lab& practical sessions are very good and complementary to the 
theory covered in lectures.
●Software Tool: CST/ADS software is a very useful tool to design electromagnetic 
components and see the wave propagation behaviour in an understandable way.
●Design Project: Design project relates well to the theory learned and to the real world 
requirements. Also testing the designed antenna is really interesting.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
In response to the SETU of this unit, the following changes have been made:
●Flipped Learning: Recorded lectures are available for students to watch before lectures. 
Students are advised to watch these and attempt relevant quizzes before attending lectures.
●Interactive Classes: Lectures will be delivered through interactive mode. Students will be 
asked questions and could also be asked to solve problems during lectures.
●Problem-based Tutorials: Students will be divided into groups. Each group will be asked to 
solve a problem in each practical session/tutorial. These sessions are used for assessment.
●Teaching: Students wanted the lecturer to conduct the tutorials. From previous offering, this 
wish has been accommodated
●Laboratory Classes: Due to differences in facilities, the laboratory classes are different in 
Malaysia and Clayton. For this reason, the assessments based on these are also different. 
In Malaysia, the following changes have been made:
●Since there were faults in the old equipment used for antenna labs, new ones have 
been bought. The antenna lab tasks have also been revised based on these.
●A hardware-based lab test has been introduced in Malaysia as a replacement for 
design project in Clayton.
●Assessments: Students felt the marks allocated to continuous assessments are low. For this 
reason, the more marks have been given to continuous assessments in this offering.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Section C: All students 
Extensions and penalties
The due dates for the submission of assignments are given in the previous section. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension is a matter of course.
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
 the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificate.before
The evidences should preferably be forwarded as an email attachment, sent to the unit 
coordinator. The email should be sent from your University email address with your name typed in 
lieu of signature.
Note that other teaching staff cannot grant extensions. Lecturer-in-charge (unit coordinator) will 
indicate at the time of granting the extension whether any penalty in marks will apply to the 
submitted work.
If an extension is granted, the approval must be attached to the assessment, where relevant.
No extensions will be given except in exceptional circumstances.
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
your laboratory reports and design project work, but 10% of the total marks available for these 
assessments will usually be deducted for each day late.
No assessment work will be accepted once a marked assessment work has been returned to the 
class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assessment works to 
safeguard against the loss of work through accident or error.
Returning assignments

Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
