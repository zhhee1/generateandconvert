Unit handbook information
Synopsis
The unit further explores the integration of multiple devices on a chip. MOS and BJT single ended 
as well as differential amplifier circuits, along with basic analogue circuit blocks like the current 
mirror, are introduced and developed using small signal models. Practical Operational Amplifiers 
are considered where properties deviate from ideal in terms of frequency response, CMMR, noise, 
stability and input/output impedance. The use of feedback in electronic circuits is studied, and 
ways to improve arising stability issues in operational amplifiers (eg using pole compensation) are 
discussed. Nyquist is presented and frequency domain analysis and design shall be explicitly 
explored via Bode plots. Concepts of State Space representation, transfer functions, canonical 
realisation, observability and controllability and discrete-time systems are presented.

Section A: For Clayton students
Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.
TBD by the Faculty.
Teaching and learning method
 Lectureand tutorials or problem classes seminars
Lectures will provide the theoretical foundations of this unit. Practice classes will supplement this 
material with design examples. Laboratories will provide students a hands-on learning.
Learning outcomes
1. To extend semiconductor theory to additional electronic devices and to integrated circuit 
structures.
2. To gain more detailed knowledge and understanding of electronic amplifier circuits, and to 
understand how transistors and electronics are used in higher frequency and oscillator 
applications.
3. Introduce feedback, stability and dominant pole compensation.
4. To understand SISO control systems, state space modelling and their relationship to 
transfer functional representation.
5. To introduce discrete-time/sampled-data control systems.
To extend the ability and practical skills to:
6. design electronic circuits using simulation tools and construct, debug and verify the 
operation of electronic circuits in the laboratory.
7. design and experimentally verify the operation of SISO control systems.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.

Teaching and learning method
Lecture, Tutorials and Laboratory-based classes
 
Face-to-face lectures will provide a learning environment for theoretical fundamentals of the unit. 
Several active learning and engaging strategies such group discussion, pause for reflection, think-
pair-share and informal quiz are embedded to the face-to-face lectures to enhance students 
learning experience. These active learning and engaging strategies are also expected to provide 
an opportunity for ongoing feedback.
Tutorials will provide an opportunity for problem-based learning; taking the concepts from the 
lectures and providing concrete examples of their application.
Laboratory-based classes will also provide a problem-based learning environment with elements of 
enquiry-based and hands-on approaches. They allow students to work on their skills in analysis.
Learning outcomes
1. To extend semiconductor theory to additional electronic devices and to integrated circuit 
structures.
2. To gain more detailed knowledge and understanding of electronic amplifier circuits, and to 
understand how transistors and electronics are used in higher frequency and oscillator 
applications.
3. Introduce feedback, stability and dominant pole compensation.
4. To understand SISO control systems, state space modelling and their relationship to 
transfer functional representation.
5. To introduce discrete-time/sampled-data control systems.
To extend the ability and practical skills to:
6. design electronic circuits using simulation tools and construct, debug and verify the 
operation of electronic circuits in the laboratory.
7. design and experimentally verify the operation of SISO control systems.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit

Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
Based on the SETU comments of the last offer on learning activities and materials, for example, 
"improvement in the lecture material as they are hard to understand" and "a bit more interactive 
and more interesting so students are engaged and involve", following changes are introduced:
1.  introduce  several in-class active learning sessions including brainstorming-in-a-group, think-
pair-share, quiz and  pause-for-reflection. These are expected to offer immediate feedback on the 
amount of learning happening and can be used to upgrade/update the course delivery tasks.
2. complexity of the harder topics will be toned down by introducing post-class directed practices.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
Tutorial sessions were good
The mid semester exams were helpful.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
