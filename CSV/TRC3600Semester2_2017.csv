Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit commences with the modeling of various dynamic engineering systems, followed by the 
analysis of their transient and steady-state responses. More sophisticated analytical methods such 
as root locus and frequency response will be explored and will build the foundation for controller 
design in the future. Modeling via state-space methods will also be briefly covered.
Mode of delivery
Malaysia (Day)
Clayton (Day)
Workload requirements
3 hours of lectures, 2 hours of tutorials and 6 hours of private study per week plus two 3-hour 
laboratories during semester.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Section C: All students 
Extensions and penalties
All assignments are to be submitted via the MAE3408/TRC3600 assignment box located in the 
foyer Ground Level of Building 31, next to Mechanical Engineering Office. The assignments must 
be submitted in hardcopy (paper-based).  
Returning assignments
Assignments will be returned during Tutorial/practical classes.
 
Students can expect assignments to be returned no more than four weeks from the submission 
date or after receipt, whichever is later.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
Referencing requirements
Referencing may be required in some circumstances – students should utilise any acceptable 
referencing styles such as Oxford. 
To build your skills in citing and referencing, and using different referencing styles, see the online 
tutorial Academic Integrity: Demystifying Citing and Referencing at
http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/tutorials/citing/
