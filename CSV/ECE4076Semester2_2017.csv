Teaching and learning method
●Laboratory-based classes
●​Hands-on exercises provide a chance to experience the application of the techniques presented in lectures
●Lecture and/or tutorials
●​Lectures are used to present the core material for the unit, while tutorial sessions are used to provide a 
risk-free environment for students to attempt problems, receive feedback and deepen their understanding
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:
1. Describe camera models.
2. Describe the elements of the human visual system and perception.

2. Describe the elements of the human visual system and perception.
3. Apply geometry and photometry to image analysis.
4. Generate implementations for low level vision processes such as linear filtering, edge 
detection, texture, multi view geometry, stereopsis, structure from motion and optical flow 
and mid-level vision processes, such as segmentation and clustering, model fitting and 
tracking.
5. Design high-level vision processes such as model-based vision, surfaces and outlines, 
graphs, range data, templates and classifiers and learning methods.
6. Generate code to complete computer vision programming exercises in programming 
languages such as C and MatLab.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing

acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
