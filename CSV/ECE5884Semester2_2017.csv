Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit introduces the fundamentals of wireless communications and networking. Students will 
learn about the characteristics of wireless channels, coding, modulation techniques, methods of 
combating fading including space, time and frequency diversity, multiple access techniques and 
cellular networks.
A selection of more advanced topics will also be covered including MIMO systems, heterogeneous 
networks, cognitive and cooperative communications.

Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 2 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 2 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 2 competencies are relevant to each unit.
TBD by the Faculty
Teaching and learning method
Lectures and Tutorials
 
There will be three set contact hours per week for face-to-face teaching in this unit. We will 
assume that relevant material has been read before these contact hours and this will be 
encouraged through online quizzes and preliminary lab work. We will run these contact hours as a 
mix between traditional lectures and tutorials and they will be very interactive. In the 
implementation component of the unit you will work to implement a communication system using 
software-defined-radios. The relevant laboratory will be open for seven hours every week to 
enable you to complete the set tasks.
Learning outcomes
At the successful completion of this unit you will be able to:
1. Identify common radio channel impairments such as noise, fading and interference to 
synthesise theoretical channel models.
2. Determine theoretical error-performance of wireless systems for comparison against 
practical measurements.
3. Analyse theoretical capacity of wireless communication systems that employ spatial and 
temporal diversity methods.
4. Design appropriate transmitter and receiver signal processing functionalities for wireless

4. Design appropriate transmitter and receiver signal processing functionalities for wireless 
systems and demonstrate its performance on a software defined radio hardware platform.
5. Assess space-time coding schemes that are capable of improving the channel capacity of 
wireless systems.
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
Need to revise the syllabus and start from the basics so that students can follow and relate to what 
they previously studied.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
The teaching staff are all very good and have clear explanations.  
The content is well organised.  
Overall this was a good unit.

Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
