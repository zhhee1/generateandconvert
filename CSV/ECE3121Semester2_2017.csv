Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit explores electrostatic, magnetostatic and electromagnetic fields, and their use to create 
devices and systems. Mathematical concepts are used to describe the fields, and examine the 
basic laws governing the generation of fields and their interactions with dielectric and magnetic 
materials. This study results in Maxwell's field equations, and related Laplace, Poisson and 
continuity equations. The real life applications of electromagnetic fields in radio communications 
and devices such as scanners, printers and mass spectrometers are also explored in this unit. 
Finally, plane wave propagation is analysed briefly as an extension of Maxwell's field equations.

The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
