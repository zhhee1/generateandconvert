Unit handbook information
Synopsis
The unit introduces basic theory behind the organic electronics and micro technologies related to 
micro sensors, micro actuators and organic devices such as Organic LEDs (OLEDs). The topics 
include study of materials used in organic electronics and MEMS, study of their electrical and 
mechanical properties, basic structures in micro devices such as cantilever beams and comb 
structures, the fabrication techniques involved in manufacturing micro and nano structures, and 
measurement techniques suitable for characterising micro devices. Examples will include 
principles of physical sensors; piezoelectric effect based microsensors; chemical microsensors; 
OLED devices; MEMS and microsystems computer based simulations. An elementary part of the 
unit will be the laboratory exercises and project work to produce micro devices and construct 
suitable electronic circuits/simulate to demonstrate their applications.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
