Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
Referencing requirements
Where you utilise programming code from a textbook or the internet, you must make this clear and 
reference the source, just as you would in a written essay.
To build your skills in citing and referencing, and using different referencing styles, see the online 
tutorial Academic Integrity: Demystifying Citing and Referencing at
http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/tutorials/citing/
Assignment submission
Hard Copy Submission:
Assignments must include a cover sheet. The coversheet is accessible via the Monash portal page 
located at  under the heading 'Learning and teaching tools'. Please keep http://my.monash.edu.au
a copy of tasks completed for your records.

Please check with your Lecturer /tutor on the submission method for your assignment coversheet 
(e.g. attach a file to the online assignment submission, hand-in a hard copy, or use an electronic 
submission). Please note that it is your responsibility to retain copies of your assessments.
Online Submission: If Electronic Submission has been approved for your unit, please submit your 
work via the Moodle site or other; as directed by your demonstator for this unit.
Please keep a copy of tasks completed for your records.
 The CATME online peer assessment tool will be used to allow CATME Online Peer Assessment:
team members to anonymously rate the contributions made to each team assignment by both 
themselves and their team mates. Students will be required to complete a calibration process 
which demonstrates how the system should be used. At the conclusion of each assignment they 
will then rate themselves and their team mates on the basis of five key criteria, and using a 
behaviourally anchored scale. The individual ratings you give each person are not viewable or 
shared with other team members, but will be reviewed by the teaching staff. You will be asked to 
justify (via comments) why you rated particular people high or low. You are NOT allowed to simply 
rate everyone the same, or have your team all give each member the same ratings. Doing so will 
incur an automatic penalty if you do so.
Based on these ratings a Peer Assessment Factor will be calculated by the system for each team 
member, and then reviewed and potentially moderated by the teaching staff in light of the written 
comments. This factor is a number potentially between 0 and 1.15, but for the vast majority of 
student it is usually between 0.9 and 1.05. This factor will be returned confidentially to students via 
Moodle Gradebook, and will be used to generate an individual mark for each student's assignment 
work, based on their team’s mark for each of the assignments.
Upon release of the results, CATME will send each student a link which will allow them to see, for 
each of the five questions, an arrow indicating:
how they scored themselves;
the AVERAGE of what the team scored them personally;
the AVERAGE of what the team scored all team members CATME will also provide detailed 
suggestions for improvement based on where your results fall relative to the rest of the team.
For more information please visit this link: http://info.catme.org/
Feedback to you 
Types of feedback you can expect to receive in this unit are:
●Feedback on work in prac classes
●Graded assignments with comments
●Graded assignments without comments
●Quiz results with explanations
