Unit handbook information
Synopsis
Together with ECE4094 Project A this unit is a challenging opportunity to pursue independently an 
individual project and is likely to require extended effort. The two units together normally include a 
preparatory literature survey and developmental work such as design, construction and 
programming. Students choose a project that interests them, and are assigned to a team of two 
supervising staff members.

Hurdle requirements 
At the end of Project A, students will present the results of their project to date. This will be in the 
form of a presentation with a demonstration where appropriate of progress to date and all 
supporting required submissions. A panel of academics including the project supervisor and an 
independent academic, to be determined by the unit coordinator, will assess the milestones and 
progress at which time the student must defend their efforts and justify why the project should be 
allowed to continue.
At the mid-point of the project or the conclusion of Project A, the panel will determine if the project 
is to be permitted to continue, taking into consideration all of the required submissions outlined in 
the Assessment Summary above. If the project is to continue the student will be notified via 
Moodle following the release of results according to faculty policy. As the project is only half 
complete at this stage, the official result for ECE4094 will indicate Result Withheld (WH) 
temporarily until the project is complete at the end of ECE4095 Project B.
If in the event a project is not permitted to continue, the mid project review will record a fail against 
Project A ECE4094. A numerical mark will be returned based on the evidence presented to the 
mid point of the project for Project A only.  No mark will be recorded against ECE4095 for a project 
which fails to meet requirements at the end of ECE4094.

At the end of Project A, students will present the results of their project to date. This will be in the 
form of a presentation with a demonstration where appropriate of progress to date and all 
supporting required submissions. A panel of academics including the project supervisor and an

supporting required submissions. A panel of academics including the project supervisor and an 
independent academic, to be determined by the unit coordinator, will assess the milestones and 
progress at which time the student must defend their efforts and justify why the project should be 
allowed to continue.
At the mid-point of the project or the conclusion of Project A, the panel will determine if the project 
is to be permitted to continue, taking into consideration all of the required submissions outlined in 
the Assessment Summary above. If the project is to continue the student will be notified via 
Moodle following the release of results according to faculty policy. As the project is only half 
complete at this stage, the official result for ECE4094 will indicate Result Withheld (WH) 
temporarily until the project is complete at the end of ECE4095 Project B.
If in the event a project is not permitted to continue, the mid project review will record a fail against 
Project A ECE4094. A numerical mark will be returned based on the evidence presented to the 
mid point of the project for Project A only.  No mark will be recorded against ECE4095 for a project 
which fails to meet requirements at the end of ECE4094.
Students whose projects are not permitted to continue must dis-enrol from Project B and 
recommence a new project beginning with Project A ECE4094 in a subsequent semester.
The project is marked at its conclusion, the end of ECE4095, out of 100.
Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, 
discussions in class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment marks and 
grades.  Students/You are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their/your 
learning
Students may receive feedback in several ways:
●In response to weekly journal entries made by students placed on the Moodle page
●Through weekly contact with supervisors
●Through email discussion with supervisors or the unit coordinator
●Through oral discussions conducted in laboratories or places of testing and demonstration 
with their project supervisor
●Through direct oral interaction with the assessment panel
●Through written or oral comments associated with each milestone
Students will receive regular verbal feedback from their project supervisor. To facilitate this, 
students should hold regular meetings with their supervisor.
ECE4095 Project B - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (34) Break----------------

Feedback may take the form of advice, direction, suggestion or an indication that a task may or 
may not be to the satisfaction of the supervisor or unit coordinator.
Since the majority of projects are conducted with close association with a supervisor and there is 
significant opportunity for the student to meet with their supervisor on many occasions not all 
feedback will be documented. This unit provides a mechanism through direct weekly meetings, 
journal entries, presentations and impromptu meetings for students to gain significant feedback. 
Students are encouraged to document each meeting they have with their supervisor as part of 
their weekly journal. Failure to update the journal on a weekly basis may substantially limit the kind 
and type and delivery of feedback available. Students have a responsibility if they require feedback 
to ask for it at the time it is needed. There is of course no guarantee the feedback received will be 
to the students liking.
