calculate even and odd series, and apply these to solving simple periodic systems
4. Perform change of variables for multivariable functions with the chain rule, use polar 
coordinates, represent 2D and 3D curves parametrically and solve line integrals on these 
curves
5. Manipulate and evaluate double and triple integrals in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical 
coordinates
6. Calculate the gradient, divergence and curl vector operations, and apply these in the 
evaluation of surface and volume integrals through the Gauss and Stokes theorems
7. Solve elementary partial differential equations, apply boundary and initial conditions as 
appropriate, and use the method of separation of variables with the wave equation, heat 
equation and Laplace's equation
8. Appreciate key issues related to the numerical solution of full and sparse linear systems
9. Apply a range of suitable techniques for the numerical solution of ODEs, including using 
discrete Fourier transforms, PS and FE methods
10. Use a range of suitable simple numerical techniques for the solution of PDEs and 
appreciate their advantages and disadvantages
11. Use MATLAB and other appropriate software to assist in understanding these 
mathematical techniques
12. Express and explain mathematical techniques and arguments clearly in words.
Teaching approach
ENG2005 is taught using a combination of lectures, support classes and computer laboratories. At 
the Clayton campus casual assistance is also available through the Mathematics Learning Centre 
in 9, Rainforest Walk or consultation times with your lecturers.  The unit  will have all  lectures audio
/videos recorded. Also,  students are encouraged to watch short videos  before the lecture
 session, to revise previous material and become familiar with the learning outcomes of the lecture. 
  Complementary videos Time is devoted in lecture  to new concepts, examples and discussions.
related to each mathematical topic (demonstrations of mathematical problems) will be available on 
Moodle to enhance the learning experience of students. Recorded (video) information 
ENG2005 Advanced engineering mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017

Moodle to enhance the learning experience of students. Recorded (video) information 
from lectures is also available  via Moodle. The lecture notes, the problem sets  and the tasks for 
each numerical module are made available on the Moodle website for ENG2005. Assignments will 
be posted also on Moodle.
There will be thirty six lectures in Semester 2,  held weekly depending on the day of the week of 
the timetabled lectures. 
Written lecture notes will be made available, after lectures, on the Moodle site, under the 
corresponding mathematical topic.
Students should aim to attend: every lecture in order to gain full advantage of the teaching and use 
the recordings to check on any points that they missed.
Students are also expected to attend:
●one two-hour support class per week fromweek of semester. The support  the second 
classes are intended to help students gain assistance with the theory described in lectures 
and the practice exercises given on the ‘problem sets’. Quizzes and assignments alternate. 
Quizzes will happen in the practice classes. Each student will have about 11 support classes 
for ENG2005 weeks 2-12.
●one hour computer laboratory per fortnight (on either odd or even weeks on Monday-
Wednesday) from the  week of semester. The computer laboratories are intended to second
help students with the numerical modules. Students will be assessed on the numerical 
which are due at the end of weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. modules 
Optional drop-in sessions each week on Thursday and Friday will be made available for students 
requiring additional assistance learning the material for the computer modules.
At Clayton campus there are many different support classes each week (as well as options for 
computer laboratories) and you will be assigned to a particular class though Allocate+ at 
http://allocate.timetable.monash.edu. If your circumstances change you can alter your initial 
allocation no later than the end of Week 3. Once you have been allocated to a particular support 
class (or laboratory) you must attend only that support class.
 
Feedback to you
Feedback is provided to ENG2005 students in a variety of ways during the semester, to assist their 
learning and help them identify the issues for which they may need to seek further assistance. This 
includes through:
●  individual or group consultations at the lecturer’s weekly consultation Consultation Times: 
hours, at other times  by appointment via email;
●  individual and group consultations and discussion with staff during the Support classes:
weekly support classes;
●  individual and group consultations with demonstrator during the Computer Laboratories:
ENG2005 Advanced engineering mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017

●  individual and group consultations with demonstrator during the Computer Laboratories:
weekly labs;
●  assistance through the Mathematics Learning Centre (MLC) Mathematics Learning Centre:
for mathematical questions (no assistance with the numerical modules can be provided)
●Short Assignments: written feedback on the  five assignments submitted to your tutor, is 
usually marked and returned at the next week support class  with sample solutions available 
on Moodle. All assignments will be released via the Moodle webpage.
●Short Quizzes:  five  short quizzes in the last 20 minutes of your support class, designed to 
be run every two weeks; the marked quiz returned at the next class
● encouraging students to ask questions in or after lecturesLectures: 
●ENG2005 Forums: on Moodle.
In particular, it is also strongly recommended that you take full advantage of the assistance and 
feedback provided in the support classes for ENG2005.
If you are having any sort of difficulties consult the appropriate staff (your support class tutor, your 
lecturer or your campus unit  coordinator) as soon as possible after you become aware of the 
difficulty.
See  for information on some of the support services available http://www.monash.edu.au/students
within the university.

Assessment tasks
Quizzes and Assignments run alternatively, from week 2 till week 11 inclusive. Students are not 
 Strict deadlines are imposed permitted to resit quizzes or resubmit assignments for ENG2005. 
with continuous assessments (quizzes, assignments, numerical module). 
Quizzes: There are 5 quizzes for the theoretical part of the unit.   Each quiz is worth 2% of the final 
mark.  The quizzes will run for 20 minutes at the end of each 2-hour support class.
The intention of the quizzes is to assist students in keeping up with and understanding the lecture 
material, and to provide feedback on their performance. Sample solutions are not provided. If you 
are unsure about the correct answer, please ask your support class leader to explain how the 
correct answer is obtained preferably during the support class at which it is handed back to you. 
Calculators are not permitted in quizzes, but formula sheets are provided if needed. Different 
quizzes will be set for different support classes, and you must normally complete the work that is 
assigned for the support class in which you are enrolled.
Assignments: There are 5 assignments to be completed during the semester. The assignments 
are due for submission every two weeks (read the assessment unit time table). All assignments 
will be released via the Moodle webpage.  All assignments must be submitted in your support 
 Each assignment is worth 3% of the final mark. Electronic class, to  your allocated tutor.
Assignments must be submission of assignments will not be accepted under any circumstances. 
submitted in hard copy with a signed cover sheet   of your allocated support class . at the start
The intention of the assignments is to assist students in keeping up with and understanding the 
lecture material, and to provide feedback on how to express themselves both mathematically and 
in written English. Sample solutions are provided on Moodle. To be successful in this unit, students 
must be able to express a written mathematical argument clearly, using appropriate wording along
with mathematical symbols and notation. It is not just the correct answer that is important, but also 
a clear and logical explanation for how it was obtained. In accordance with university policy, all 
assignments must include a signed cover sheet (available on Moodle). While every care is taken, it 
is that you make a copy of your assignment for your records before it is strongly recommended 
submitted, for example on a scanner or your smartphone. Students who have previously attempted 
ENG2005 must complete all assessment work again. No marks can be carried across from a 
previous enrolment in the unit.
 Numerical modules:
There are 5 numerical modules in total. Students are expected to complete all the numerical 
modules using resources that will be provided on Moodle and with the assistance of their 
laboratory demonstrator. All the modules will be assessed electronically and feedback given in the 
computer labs. There is a fortnightly deadline for students to submit their MATLAB codes on 
Moodle. Watch the fortnightly announcement on Moodle (under advanced numerical methods) 
about deadlines and assessments in each fortnight. Any adjustments or clarifications of these 
procedures will also be announced on Moodle, so please check the latest announcements 
carefully. If the student disagrees with their mark for a given module, it is the responsibility of the 
student to show demonstrators the running MATLAB code that they uploaded to Moodle on the 
machine they are working on.  This can be a computer in the lab or a personal computer. Students 
are encouraged to challenge their grade for each module if they disagree since the Modules will be 
marked with the partial aid of computer scripts which may contain some bugs. In the event that 
student and demonstrator cannot agree, the dispute will be settled by coordinator of the numerical 
modules. In such a situation, based on the judgement of the coordinator, students may be 
ENG2005 Advanced engineering mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (9) Break----------------
11
modules. In such a situation, based on the judgement of the coordinator, students may be 
awarded more marks or less marks.
The assessment of the numerical part is based on a pass/fail/DNC method (the demonstrator will 
check if the MATLAB code for each lab problem is running correctly and if the results are correct). 
Pass means that the work shows a satisfactory completion of all objectives of the module. Fail 
indicates an unsatisfactory performance in the compulsory components. Did not complete (DNC) 
will be given to a student who fails to hand in a their submission online by the due date or their 
code does not show any serious attempt at answering the module questions.
Late assessment: Under special consideration (strict rules), students may be assessed in the 
following week. Only the unit coordinator of the numerical module, can approve late assessments. 
For medical reasons, a doctor certificate should indicate that the student is incapable of using a 
computer for a period of at least one week within the module period. Computer codes submitted or 
presented in other ways other than via the Moodle system are not accepted and Moodle will be 
electronically disabled for submissions at the due date and time for each Module.
Additional support: At Clayton campus students can seek help on their numerical modules from 
demonstrators in their allocated computer lab sessions. At Malaysia campus, the computer labs 
may only be used for assessment feedback, as there is a space limitation. Students at Malaysia 
campus may seek consultation from the unit coordinator, Dr Ooi. All students are encouraged to 
utilise the Moodle forum for advanced numerical methods to discuss their works with their fellow 
students. The forum is moderated by unit coordinators. Selected questions related to numerical 
modules will be addressed in the forum.
Video tutorials: A series of module specific MATLAB tutorial videos will be placed on Moodle to 
further assist the learning of students. Keep an eye out for those if you require additional 
assistance.
Numerical module coordinator: The numerical module coordinator at Clayton is Dr Mark Flegg (
). For Malaysian specific numerical module issues, coordinator Dr Ooi mark.flegg@monash.edu
Ean Hin (ooi.ean.hin@monash.edu) is the local contact person.
Important
It is acknowledged that students can assist their learning by discussing difficulties and helping 
each other to solve problems. However, there are limits to which they should assist each other in 
assessed work without it being considered to be 'inappropriate collusion' or cheating. It is therefore 
expected that all students should complete all final assessed work for ENG2005 individually and in 
their own words. Among other things, markers (and our automatic computer scripts) will be looking 
specifically for instances where the wording of submitted work is very similar and where there are 
identical errors in algebraic working or logic. Markers may also assess work across multiple 
classes. Instances of suspected cheating will be dealt with seriously, in accordance with Faculty 
 Note that penalties may apply for the late submission of work please see and University policies.
the section 'Extensions below. and penalties'.
Errors in marking or recording grades
Efforts are made to ensure that marks for assignments, quizzes  are awarded as consistently as 
possible across the various support classes and markers. If you feel that an error may have been 
made in the marking of any assessment, for example missed, working or incorrect addition of 
marks, you should discuss that with your support-class leader initially. It is also your responsibility 
to check in a timely manner that the correct mark for the work has been recorded on Moodle, and 
to query that with your support-class leader initially. In accordance with Faculty of Science policy, 
ENG2005 Advanced engineering mathematics - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (10) Break----------------
12
to query that with your support-class leader initially. In accordance with Faculty of Science policy, 
this should be done no later than two weeks after the return of that work. If you are not satisfied 
with the response by your support-class leader you may contact the Chief Examiner of the unit 
(listed on the front page) to arrange a meeting. 
Examination(s)
Continuous assessment: 40%
Examination (3 hours): 60%
●Work during semester determines 40% of the final unit mark for ENG2005, with the 
remaining 60% based on results from the three-hour final examination, to be held in the 
university examination period at the end of semester. Note that calculators are not permitted 
in the final examination.
●Students are required to achieve at least 45% in the total continuous assessment component 
and at least 45% in the final examination component and an overall mark of 50% to achieve 
a pass grade in the unit. Students failing to achieve this requirement will be given a 
maximum of 45% in the unit.
 
Applications for special consideration
The purpose of Special Consideration is to give a student, whose work for a particular piece of 
assessment has been adversely affected by exceptional circumstances beyond their control, a 
further opportunity to demonstrate their ability.
For matters related to special consideration, personal circumstances please first read the special 
consideration policy: http://www.monash.edu/policy-bank/academic/education/learning-and-
. It is based on the Monash University policy and teaching/special-consideration-procedures
procedures for Special Consideration and it is the student's responsibility to read and understand 
the information. If you feel you satisfy the criteria under the special consideration policy then 
contact directly the  (as Malaysia Unit Coordinator or the Clayton Unit Coordinator Assistant
appropriate).
See also  for university information.http://www.monash.edu.au/exams/special-consideration.html
A student whose work during a teaching period or whose performance in an examination or other 
assessment has been affected by acute illness or other exceptional cause beyond their control

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
Based on the feedback received from students:
●We make now available videos with more worked examples based on the maths concepts 
introduced during lectures. 
●Moodle site is now interactive, with a variety of resources available for different 
student  learning style; we encourage to participate in the small  online questions  in Moodle 
(effort is rewarded)
●Quizzes and assignments are run now alternatively  every two weeks, with more marks 
allocated for assignments. 
●The Unit coordinator will have also the role of a roaming tutor, aiming at visiting all support 
classes, to help and listen to students feedback on this unit.

Other unit information
The lecturers will use an electronic tablet or just overhead projectors to write  notes. The lectures 
will be audio and video recorded too.  These written notes will be available after each lecture on 
Moodle.
 For additional maths problems linked to  the problem sets (see below), we will provide a list of 
suggested worked examples from Kreyszig's book. So if you want to know more about the 
materials studied in this unit or you want to have more practice, you will need to have access to 
this books. Some copies are available in the library or available online, but there are around 600 
students enrolled in ENG2005 this semester in two campuses, so you may find it easier to 
purchase your own copy if you need more practice.
Problem Sets
The  ‘problem sets’, with practice exercises for the material covered in lectures, can be found in as 
a separate book, covering the six major topics in the unit. Answers to these problems can be found 
immediately following each problem set. Additional exercises can also be found in the relevant 
sections of the textbooks. Limited solutions will be made available online.
Advanced Numerical Modules:
The pdf instructions on how to run each  numerical module  are on Moodle, under  the  topic: 
"Advanced Numerical Modules". 
Mathematics Learning Centre
The School of Mathematical Sciences also operates a Mathematics Learning Centre, to provide 
additional assistance to students who are encountering difficulties with lecture material and 
exercises in any of their first and second-year mathematics units (including ENG2005). No 
information on the numerical modules will be provided at MLC. The Mathematics Learning Centre 
is located in on the ground floor of 9  Rainforest Walk (Mathematics Building) at the Clayton

The topics to be assessed can vary depending on how the semester is run.
Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves  and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitiveknowledge
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the  with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective attitudes
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.
Key for the table above:
LevelCategory
C1Remembering: Recall or retrieve previous learned information.
C2Understanding: Comprehending the meaning, translation, interpolation, and 
interpretation of instructions and problems. State a problem in one's own words.
C3Applying: Use a concept in a new situation or unprompted use of an abstraction. 
Applies what was learned in the classroom into novel situations in the work place.
C4Analyzing: Separates material or concepts into component parts so that its 
organizational structure may be understood. Distinguishes between facts and 
inferences.
C5Evaluating: Make judgments about the value of ideas or materials.

Teaching Approach
Three hours lecture per week: To introduce the mathematical theories to the students. 
Replacement classes will be held on days when the scheduled lecture falls on a public 
holiday.
Two hours tutorial per week: To show some examples of how to apply the mathematical 
theories learnt from the lectures.
Complementary recorded lectures will be uploaded to help students to revise. However, note 
that recorded lectures are substitutes for attending lectures or reading the lecture notes.NOT 
Minimum of seven hours of independent study per week: Self-study by the students.
Numerical Module
One hour lecture per week: To introduce the theory and concept pertaining to the numerical 
module to be covered on that particular week.
The numerical module is a  module and students are expected to download the self-directed
reading materials from Moodle and to answer all Problems.
If students have any questions regarding the module, they may seek consultation either from 
the unit coordinator Dr Ooi, Dr Chang  by posting their questions in a specialized forum in OR
Moodle.
Students must submit their codes/solutions in two forms, i.e. the *.m file and the PDF 
containing responses to the solutions, online via the Moodle webpage according to the 
assessment table shown below.
Assignment submission
All assignments are due fortnightly from the dates they are released in Moodle.
All submissions must be done during the tutorial classes. Submission to assignment boxes 
or to the Lecturer/Tutor outside of the allocated tutorials will not be accepted without a valid 
reason.
Students whose tutorials fall on a public holiday during the week of Assignment submissions 
will submit their assignment through an allocated Assignment box.
