Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This unit introduces the student to modern logic design techniques, hardware used and common 
representations. Topics include two and multi-level combinational logic, decoders, multiplexers, 
arithmetic circuits, programmable and steering logic, flip-flops, registers, counters, RAM and ROM. 
Using this hardware the design component will include finite state machine design and applications 
to computer data path control. This will incorporate simple analogue and digital I/O interfacing. 
Programmable logic devices will be covered, and the use of a hardware description language for 
describing, synthesising and testing digital logic. Laboratories cover logic design, implementation, 
and testing.

Teaching and learning method
The unit employs many teaching approaches. The lectures are used to address common learning 
objectives of all students and provide opportunities for class discussion with questions 
encouraged. The lecturer will often ask students questions and all students are expected to 
participate in an interactive experience. Individual feedback is provided in tutorials run where 
students are set problems and their progress monitored. Detailed discussion and review of lecture 
material is also provided in tutorials in an informal and enjoyable learning atmosphere that caters 
for different learning styles. The tutorials provide students the opportunity to ask questions about 
lab material as well as receiving help to achieve their full potential. Laboratories are lecture and 
intended to provide students with a real world experience of designing, implementing and testing 
their ideas in a practical setting. The reward of achieving a working robust solution is the goal. Lab 
demonstrators will assist students in achieving this goal in the lab. Online formative quizzes in 
Moodle are provided so that students can gauge their understanding of digital logic and improving 
their understanding.

Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
More introductory material on logic gates, truth tables and Karnaugh maps will be included.
Hardware description with Verilog will be enhanced with more examples and interactive class 
work. To enhance engagement and attendance in classes, short lecture and tutorial quizzes will be 
used and these will count towards the final mark.

●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
