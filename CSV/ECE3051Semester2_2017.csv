Unit handbook information
Synopsis
The unit begins by considering electrical machines, looking at DC machines, induction motors, 
synchronous motors and other types of motors under fixed and variable speed operation. Then 
thyristor rectifiers and switched power converters are presented, looking at their use for electrical 
energy conversion in general and variable speed motor control in particular. Finally, single and 
three phase AC networks, power factor correction, and electrical power generation, transmission 
and distribution networks are explored. Particular focus is given here to three phase transformers, 
transmission line modelling, quality of electrical supply, electrical protection systems, and power 
system control.

Section A: For Clayton students
Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 1 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 1 competencies are relevant to each unit.
Stage 1 competencies Activities used in this unit to develop stage 1
competencies
PE1.1 Knowledge of science and
engineering fundamentals
 
Theoretical lecture material, prescribed texts 
and
recommended reading, tutorial problems and
laboratory experiment
PE1.2 In-depth technical 
competence
in at least one engineering 
discipline
Appropriately chosen problems for practice 
classes and laboratory experiments.
PE1.3 Techniques and resourcesThe laboratory experiments, tutorial questions 
and
lecture notes provide a broad understanding of
equipment and power devices. Students are 
also
made aware of relevant tools for analysis and

According to past evaluations of this unit, we have set an improvement priority for this semester. It 
is to make the learning outcomes clearer; to make the unit more stimulating; to improve resources 
and to improve the level of tutoring and feedback.
Feedback is welcome at any time throughout the semester. Please use email to send it to the unit 
coordinator, or in person.
You may wish to use the open ended questions in the unit evaluation to provide written feedback 
on your experience of this and whether it has been helpful to you during this semester.

Assessment tasks
Assessment title: Laboratory Experiments
 N/AMode of delivery:
Details of task: This task consists of a preliminary work which is to be handed in at the start of 
each laboratory and the experimental work during each laboratory session. Each student must 
keep a laboratory record book, paper or electronic, in which all experimental results and on the 
spot analysis are recorded.
Preliminary work is to be handed in at the start of each laboratory. It will be marked based on the 
correctness of results. Each student must submit preliminary work.
Each student must keep a laboratory record book, paper or electronic, in which all experimental 
results and on the spot analysis are recorded. Failure to bring and use a laboratory record book 
will be given an automatic zero for the experimental achievement section of the laboratory 
assessment.
Laboratory achievement will be assessed by demonstrators at the end of the laboratory, and will 
be based on level of student preparedness, level of completion of experimental work and general 
level of competency and understanding shown during the laboratory session.
Preliminary work will be marked out of 4, the experimental achievement will be marked out of 6 to 
make the overall laboratory mark out of 10. Laboratory marks of each student will be totalled and 
 averaged at the end of the semester to make 20% of the overall assessment.

Bloom’s Taxonomy:
Three domains of educational activities have been identified under the general taxonomy known 
as Bloom’s.
●Cognitive: mental skills ()Head
●Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas ()Heart
●Psychomotor: manual or physical skills ()Hand
The  domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. This includes cognitive
the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the 
development of intellectual abilities and skills.
The domain includes the attitudes with which someone deals with things emotionally, affective 
such as feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasms and motivations.
The  domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill psychomotor
areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, 
distance, procedures, or techniques in execution.

Section C: All students 
Extensions and penalties
The due date for the submission of assignments are given in the previous section. Please make 
every effort to submit work by the due dates. Students are advised to NOT assume that granting of 
an extension os a matter of the course. 
If you need an extension for any of the assignments, you must submit a written request 48-hours 
before the due time and date, and attach supportive evidence such as medical certificates.  
If you are late in applying for an extension or you don’t have a good reason, you should still submit 
the work, but 10% of the total marks available for that assessment component will usually be 
deducted for each day late.
No assignment will be accepted once an assignment has been returned to the class.
Deferred tests and examinations may be granted in cases of extenuating personal circumstances 
such as serious personal illness or bereavement.
Remember, you are required to keep an up-to-date copy of all submitted assignments to safeguard 
against the loss of work through accident or error.
Returning assignments
Students can expect assignments to be returned within two weeks of the submission date or after 
receipt, whichever is later.
Resubmission of assignments
Students may resubmit an assignment if it is approved by the course coordinator.
Plagiarism and collusion
Intentional plagiarism or collusion amounts to cheating under Part 7 of the Monash University 
(Council) Regulations.
Plagiarism: Plagiarism means taking and using another person’s ideas or manner of expressing 
them and passing them off as one’s own. For example, by failing to give appropriate 
acknowledgement. The material used can be from any source (staff, students or the internet, 
published and unpublished works).
ECE3051 Electrical energy systems - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (23) Break----------------
25
Collusion: Collusion means unauthorised collaboration with another person on assessable written, 
oral or practical work and includes paying another person to complete all or part of the work. 
Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that intentional plagiarism or collusion has 
occurred, this will be reported to the Associate Dean (Education) or delegate,
Referencing requirements

the approaches they have been adopting towards their assigned coursework, and to take the 
opportunity to modify these approaches where necessary.
