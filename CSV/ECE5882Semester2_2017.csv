Unit handbook information
Synopsis
This an advanced unit in electronics design. Students will be provided with an in-depth knowledge 
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave circuits and systems. The unit builds on students' basic 
electronic knowledge obtained from their undergraduate engineering degree to a more advanced 
analog and RF electronics, with more theory and applications of electronics.
The unit will teach students the detailed design principles of passive and active electronic devices 
at radio frequencies. Students will learn to use CAD design software packages for assignments 
and projects. Important analogue and RF building components such as amplifiers, filters, 
oscillators, modulators, mixers and phase locked loops will be taught. Topics such as noise and 
interference in electronics circuits will also be covered.
Students will undertake a group project where RF/mixed signal circuits will be designed, built and 
tested in the laboratory.

Academic Overview
Engineers Australia Stage 2 competencies
The Engineers Australia Policy on Accreditation of Professional Engineering Programs requires 
that all programs ensure that their engineering graduates develop to a substantial degree the 
stage 2 competencies. Listed below are the activities in this unit that will help you to achieve these 
competencies.
Note: that not all stage 2 competencies are relevant to each unit.

Note: that not all stage 2 competencies are relevant to each unit.
Stage 2 competenciesActivities used in this unit to develop stage 
2 competencies
PE1.1 Knowledge of science and engineering 
fundamentals
Acquired through lecture material , 
prescribed texts and recommended reading
PE1.2 In-depth technical competence in at least 
one engineering discipline
Technical competencies in following areas:
Analog/RF electronics, Microwave theory, 
Circuit design, practical circuit design and 
testing
PE1.3 Techniques and resourcesAnalog, RF and microwave circuits and 
systems design can be learned through a 
comprehensive set of lectures, tutorials and 
practical sessions
PE1.4 General knowledgeProblem-based learning can be achieved 
through laboratory classes and project 
based self-study that should be completed 
by students as the practical assessment
 PE2.1 Ability to undertake problem 
identification, formulation, and solution
Acquired through tutorials that promote 
critical thinking, and a project that requires 
students to put all the theories they learnt 
into practice.
PE2.2 Understanding of social, cultural, global, 
and environmental responsibilities and the need 
to employ principles of sustainable development
The projects and laboratory work requires 
students  to get an understanding of EMC 
related issues that are associated with RF 
design
PE2.3 Ability to utilise a systems approach to 
complex problems and to design and operational 
performance
Students are required to complete a 
complex group project as their practical 
assessment. This involves applying 
systems approach to design of a complex 
electronics circuit.
PE2.4 Proficiency in engineering designStudent get proficiency in following areas 
through laboratory classes and design 
projects: Electronic circuit design, hardware, 
testing of circuits, Altium PCB design
PE2.5 Ability to conduct an engineering projectThis is achieved through participation in 
structured lab sessions and project based 
assessment
PE2.6 Understanding of the business 
environment
A basic knowledge of electronic industry in 
Australia is conveyed to student during 
lectures
PE3.1 Ability to communicate effectively, with 
the engineering team and with the community at 
large
Students are required to work as a team to 
complete their lab classes and project. They 
are also required to produce a technical 
report as a part of the project.
PE3.2 Ability to manage information and 
documentation
Students are required to obtain information 
from an extensive set of technical 
ECE5882 Advanced electronics design - Semester 2 (S2-01) - 2017
----------------Page (5) Break----------------

documentation in order to successfully 
complete the project
PE3.3 Capacity for creativity and innovationLaboratory classes and the project based 
assessment provides students with the 
opportunity to be creative and innovative in 
analogue and RF circuit design
PE3.4 Understanding of professional and ethical 
responsibilities, and commitment to them
PE3.5 Ability to function effectively as an 
individual and in multidisciplinary and

Teaching and learning method
●Lecture and problem solving classes
●Laboratory-based classes
The unit consists of lectures and practice classes with some computer laboratory classes. In 
addition to lectures, learning in the unit is achieved through the laboratory, and has a number of 
components, which build to form the final project. The main learning approach is “Problem- based 
learning” which requires students to be involved with the project and proactive learners.
Laboratory allocation
There are 3-hours of laboratory classes scheduled each week. There is only one laboratory 
session per week.
Communication, participation and feedback
Monash aims to provide a learning environment in which students receive a range of ongoing 
feedback throughout their studies. In this unit it will take the form of group feedback via practice 
classes, individual feedback, peer feedback, self-comparison, verbal and written feedback, 
discussions in class, as well as more formal feedback related to assignment marks and grades. 
Students/You are encouraged to draw on a variety of feedback to enhance their/your learning.
Learning outcomes
On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
●analyse RF and microwave electronic components, circuits and systems
●design and implement RF and mixed signal electronic devices
●formulate, plan, create, document, validate and simulate RF and mixed signal electronic 
designs with the effective use of appropriate modern CAD design software tools
●test and characterise RF and microwave electronics using appropriate test equipment

●test and characterise RF and microwave electronics using appropriate test equipment
Your feedback to us
One of the formal ways students have to provide feedback on teaching and their learning 
experience is through the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) survey. The feedback 
is anonymous and provides the Faculty with evidence of aspects that students are satisfied with 
and areas for improvement.
Previous student evaluations of this unit
In response to previous SETU results of this unit, the following changes have been made:
We will add a few more problems at the end of each lecture. These problems will make sure 
students will understand the concept of electronics better.
Student feedback has highlighted the following strength(s) in this unit:
Students were happy with the unit in the last SETU. Many positive comments were received. e.g. 
contents were inspiring, labs were very good, all important concepts of electronics were covered, 
the unit is handled well etc.
